# Content Page Flow

This document explains the flow and structure of the content pages in the OxiNews dashboard.

## Overview

The content section of the dashboard allows users to view content generated by their pipelines. The flow has been designed to provide a clear and organized way to navigate through pipeline content.

## Page Structure

The content section consists of three main pages:

1. **Pipeline List Page** (`/dashboard/content`)
   - Shows all available pipelines
   - Each pipeline is displayed as a card with its name
   - Clicking on a pipeline card navigates to the content list for that pipeline

2. **Content List Page** (`/dashboard/content/[id]`)
   - Shows a list of all content items for a selected pipeline
   - Displays the title and creation date for each content item
   - Content items are sorted by creation date (newest first)
   - Clicking on a content item navigates to the detailed view

3. **Content Detail Page** (`/dashboard/content/[id]/[contentId]`)
   - Shows the detailed view of a single content item
   - Renders the content using the ContentTemplate component if it has the detailed structure
   - Falls back to a basic rendering for legacy content format

## Components

The content section uses the following components:

1. **ContentPipelineList** - Displays a list of all pipelines
2. **ContentPipelineCard** - Displays a single pipeline card
3. **PipelineContentList** - Displays a list of content items for a pipeline
4. **PipelineContentView** - Displays the detailed view of a content item
5. **ContentTemplate** - Renders the detailed content structure

## Navigation

## Content Structure

The content detail page can render two types of content:

1. **Detailed Structure** - Content that follows the structure defined in ContentTemplate.tsx
2. **Legacy Format** - Basic content with title, description, and URL

## Sorting

Content items in the Content List page are sorted by creation date in descending order (newest first).

## Demo

A demo of the content template is available at `/dashboard/content/demo`. This demo shows how the template renders example content and can be used as a reference for creating new content.
