	- Generate a list of themes that are directly tied to the focus topic, ensuring they will serve as the foundation for distinct content clusters.
	- Each theme must be a single, concise, and powerfully engaging titleâ€”crafted specifically for domain experts. 
    - Do NOT use **title-subtitle** format. Each theme must be a single title without any secondary titles.
	- The themes should immediately capture attention, offering precise, dynamic insights without resorting to generic or overly broad language.
	- Your ultimate goal is to create a list of themes that transforms the material into an exciting, expert-level narrative.
