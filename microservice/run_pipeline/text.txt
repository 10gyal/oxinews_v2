While many blockchain solutions focus on speed and efficiency, privacy is often overlooked, leaving user data exposed.  Oasis Network is addressing this issue by providing confidential smart contracts through its Sapphire EVM, which allows for secure transactions and private data management while maintaining decentralization. This approach can be particularly useful for crypto banking applications that require sensitive financial data to remain private while still benefiting from blockchain\'s transparency and security.

Right now, I\\u2019m still in the early stages of structuring the project, but building a strong community will definitely be important down the road. I\\u2019d love to stay in touch and keep you updated as things progress! Do you have experience in community management for blockchain projects?\\n| | | xsinxxxx (1 upvotes): Yessir may We discuss this in direct messages?\\n| | | | Rich-Contribution514 (1 upvotes): yeah np\\n| | | | | NWA55 (1 upvotes): I would like that too since I\\u2019m on a project which has the same aspects and maybe we might work around it Dm me\\n| xsinxxxx (1 upvotes): Check out the Red dot pay card from Visa i believe its similar to what youre trying to figure out\\n| | Rich-Contribution514 (1 upvotes): Thanks for the suggestion! I\\u2019ll definitely check out the Red Dot Pay card to see how they handle things. Are you familiar with their tech stack or how they manage fiat-to-crypto transactions? Would love to hear your insights!\\n| ProjectCircl (1 upvotes): few pointers   1. get to know AI and use it to struture your ideas +. get insights   2. study MICA regulations or whatever is in your country. if you think worldwide then need to know about MICA anyway   3.get partnered with a lawyer to get feedback. get him interested in the project   4.see what technologies have strongest backing in means of community and support, i dont think this is a project for testing out new, just rolled out platforms good luck!\\n| | NWA55 (1 upvotes): Solid advice\\n| | Rich-Contribution514 (1 upvotes): Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it! I\\u2019ve already started looking into MiCA since regulation is a key part of making this project work long-term. Do you have any recommendations on where to find solid legal resources or communities where I can connect with blockchain lawyers? Also, regarding AI, what are some of the best tools you\\u2019d suggest for structuring ideas in Web3?\\n| | | ProjectCircl (1 upvotes): i would look for a lawyer experienced in financial area, it is easier for him to add mica knowledge in resume i think. main thing you are doing is banking so that knowledge comes first i think. blockchain is the \\"how\\" Regarding AI i use paid chatGPT and Grok in parallel. Grok seems to give sometimes better business related suggestions but its good to play with both. Dont forget that AI should be your assistant, dont relay 100% on what they say. The success of the project depends on how deep you get into each topic (my way of doing things) so you know thtaa nobody can BS you (including AI :) )\\n| | | | Rich-Contribution514 (1 upvotes): That makes a lot of sense! Banking is definitely the core, and MiCA compliance will be a key part of the project. I\'ll start looking for a financial lawyer with knowledge in fintech and blockchain. Do you have any recommendations on where to find one?   For AI, I agree\\u2014it\'s a great tool, but critical thinking is key. I\\u2019ll check out Grok as well, thanks for the tip! How do you usually integrate AI into your workflow?\\n| | | | | ProjectCircl (1 upvotes): I come up with core ideas, principles. I ask AI to critically give feedback and offer alternatives\\n| Clean_Reflection762 (1 upvotes): Everything you mentioned sounds like Qubetics. If you haven\'t heard of it yet I\'d check out the presale website there is a lot of information. It has major potential.\\n| rayQuGR (1 upvotes): If you\'re building a blockchain-based banking solution, privacy and security should be top priorities. [Oasis Network](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog) offers confidential smart contracts (Sapphire EVM), allowing financial applications to handle sensitive data securely while staying decentralized. Could be a strong foundation for privacy-first banking.\\n| | Rich-Contribution514 (1 upvotes): **Thanks for your input!** Privacy and security are indeed top priorities for us, especially in a banking project where handling sensitive data is crucial. Oasis Network and Sapphire EVM seem like interesting solutions, particularly for preserving transaction confidentiality and credit scoring while remaining decentralized. Have you used Sapphire EVM in a banking or DeFi project before? What concrete advantages have you seen compared to other solutions like zk-SNARKs or Secret Network? I\'m curious to know how it could best integrate into a project like Clairly.\\n| nickcorso (1 upvotes): Hi. I have experience in other sectors but specializing now on blockchain. Feel free to reach out if you want.\\n| Jetter91 (1 upvotes): Honestly, there are a lot of different solutions that can checked The one I am using, which is not a CEX card or Revolut or something obvious, is Trustee Plus Structure and licensing depend on the region (for Europe, you need a VASP license (be compliant with MiCA) as for example) Won\'t say that there is one unique way to ensure seamless fiat-to-crypto (or single best one) - a lot of different ones were used by myself personally for personal purposes or for businesses of my friends/partners. So it really depends on the details and requests you have. But once again - for EUR, my personal top is Trustee Plus, Revolut and any other CEX native card or something like that for daily use Among startups: Biptap, Normie Tech, Friendo Cash So, you can dive in these and happy to discuss more if you\'d like to\\n| | Rich-Contribution514 (1 upvotes): Thanks for your insights! Trustee Plus looks interesting\\u2014I\\u2019ll definitely take a closer look. Regarding the **VASP license and MiCA compliance**, I\\u2019m currently exploring what\\u2019s required to integrate fiat-to-crypto solutions in a **user-friendly** way while remaining compliant. You mentioned that different solutions worked for you depending on the specific needs\\u2014what were the biggest challenges you faced when setting up a fiat-crypto gateway? Also, among the startups you listed (Biptap, Normie Tech, Friendo Cash), which one do you think has the best model in terms of **scalability and regulation compliance**?

Hey everyone, I\\u2019ve been working on a project that aims to bridge\\u00a0**real estate and crypto**\\u00a0in a way that provides\\u00a0**real-world utility and tangible value**\\u00a0plus allows token speculation that also\\u00a0**benefits the growth**\\u00a0of the project. (basic RWA right?, not quite i think!) **How It Works:** \\u2022\\u00a0**Token Buyback**\\u00a0: A portion of rental income and asset appreciation will be used to\\u00a0**buy back tokens**, reducing supply and increasing scarcity over time. Also providing liquidity and token holders can decide how much at what time they sell back. \\u2022\\u00a0**Trading-Driven Real Estate Growth**: Small trading fees on transactions will be pooled to\\u00a0**acquire more real estate**, meaning the more trading and volatility, the faster the real estate portfolio grows and tokens are bought back - making them more valuable \\u2022\\u00a0**Community**\\u00a0can vote on additional coin launches if there are good enough Real estate projects with a acceptable yield available. I\\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any questions you might have! **1. The Idea \\u2013 What Problem Does It Solve?** Many crypto projects struggle with\\u00a0**real-world backing**, while real estate remains an asset class with\\u00a0**high barriers to entry**. Pretty much the basics of RWA ProjectCircl is designed to: \\u2022\\u00a0**Tokenize real estate**, allowing fractional ownership and liquidity. \\u2022 Provide a\\u00a0**buyback mechanism**\\u00a0that ties token value to real-world assets. \\u2022 Grow real estate holdings\\u00a0**through trading volume**, creating a\\u00a0**self-reinforcing ecosystem**. \\u2022 Offer an alternative to traditional real estate investing that is\\u00a0**more accessible and flexible**. **2. What\\u2019s Available Right Now?** We are still in the early stages, but here\\u2019s what we have so far: \\u2022\\u00a0**Website**: ready and launched \\u2022\\u00a0**Discord community**\\u00a0in very early stages \\u2022 **Initial smart contract in testing** **3. Real-World Assets and Plans** There is a specific project already chosen to serve as a first purchase with a rent yield. The first round will be done for a small inner circle to showcase the whole process and buyback mechanism. First project is located in Estonia(Europe) but the point is to have assets where-ever in the world that meet the criteria. **4. Looking for Feedback & Thoughts** Since this is a work in progress, I\\u2019d love to hear: \\u2022 What concerns would you have about a\\u00a0**crypto-real estate**\\u00a0project like this? \\u2022 Are there any features or mechanics you\\u2019d like to see? \\u2022 Any advice on compliance, security, or making it attractive to investors?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/BlockchainStartups) if you have any questions or concerns.*\\n| Jetter91 (3 upvotes): I have worked with a couple of RWA projects throughout last 2-3y on the product and strategy side (and other topics as well, if it was needed) As you may know without myself - the main problem of RWA is not \'building a platform\' part, but mostly legal (especially in worldwide case), management (especially for commercial ones - HoReCa) and creation of secondary market There are a couple more bottlenecks which are even more problematic in terms of troubleshooting (which occurs on the later stages) and some other popular RWA bottlenecks - but let\'s stick to your initial points here So, step by step:   \\u2022 There are and are a few RWA projects using token buyback mechanics. Not really unique and you need to do it properly, as half of projects that were planning to do that was skipped on my end simply due to the way of buyback   \\u2022 On trading fees - it recalls to me, that this model is pretty much widely used by RE Developers to scale their businesses, especially in Dubai and Turkey (in a form of management fee and reinvestments). Maybe the idea with trading volumes can shorten the reinvestment cycle, but there is a problem with secondary market volumes and TA should be really interested and specific - there are cases on both sides   \\u2022 For the community GTM is crucial and I can\'t really envision it on that stage - but it can be fixed (not on the later stage, as there will be no time for that) Moving on:   \\u2022 Would love to know more about the way you plan to tokenize the RE - a lot of stuff is going around compliance stuff here and not only as everything is tied up   \\u2022 Accessible/Flexible - same with other RWA projects, so this is not something to highlight   \\u2022 A worldwide approach is extremely hard to execute due to different regulations and different *Tax Law* as well (huge point on the later stage) And to summarize:   \\u2022 GTM is crucial here and should be done in a proper way (personally, I am extremely tired of broken strategies)   \\u2022 Buybacks as a mechanic should be done in a proper way   \\u2022 Scaling shouldn\'t be pursued as something immediate, as it will fall apart once you are rapid here   \\u2022 And a couple more points to avoid Imo, building a working RWA project for RE is hard due to the oversaturation of the market with working platforms, but broken businesses and global Web3 VC are tired of that stuff (if you need them at all here, lol).  Still early though, as the biggest Dubai RE Devs are happy to go this route, but going slow. My friends who had plans for that, have backlogged the idea due to the market but was happy to think of something together later on And for the final point - unreal to list and highlight everything in 1 reddit reply - so happy to continue our discussion\\n| paroxsitic (1 upvotes): \\\\> What concerns would you have about a\\u00a0**crypto-real estate**\\u00a0project like this? Why is this different than all the others? \\\\> Any advice on compliance, security, or making it attractive to investors? Register it as a security with the SEC\\n| | ProjectCircl (2 upvotes): Why is this different than all the others? - I have not seen one that addresses real estate investor side and token trader side. The strength of this project is using trading volume to also grow the portfolio.    There are many companies that do similar things, thats what makes the competition and drive market. I like realestate and I like trading so combining the two together to make a good product is what I want. Today there is no good working project jet that concentrates on community as much as I have looked. And again there is more than 1 Uber and that drives the growth of them all :) Thanks for SEC reccomendation - I will look at that also. currently working with MICA compliance\\n| xsinxxxx (1 upvotes): Wow your this project seems like it has a lot of potential!

Need Guidance from Experienced Developers!\\nAuthor: devilxor4444\\nUpvotes: 8\\nBody text:  Hey everyone, I\\u2019m a third-year undergraduate computer science student with no prior experience in blockchain development, but I\\u2019m determined to become a blockchain developer. I\\u2019ve started learning Solidity and Foundry, but I\\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content and information I need to absorb. Right now, I\\u2019m struggling with structuring my learning path and understanding how to progress effectively. For those of you who have already gone through this journey, I\\u2019d really appreciate your insights: What structured roadmap or learning path worked best for you? What resources (courses, books, projects, etc.) helped you the most? How did you bridge the gap between theory and practical development? Any tips to avoid burnout and actually retain what I learn? I\\u2019d love to hear from experienced blockchain developers about how they navigated this process. Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated!

After that, you\'ll expand your expertise once you are confident with what you have. Not a dev myself atm, but there are 2 main tracks for Web3 dev, from the feedback I have from my gf and friend, who are blockchain devs. Solidity path:   \\u2022 Check for any top 100 Solidity Interview Questions - this can be used as a roadmap   \\u2022 Check for mentors in different communities or check for communities   \\u2022 You can use Crypto Zombies to make that path gamified   \\u2022 OpenZeppelin - go, check, learn. This can be done through the Ethernaut for gamification   \\u2022 Try to create your token, try to fork something and check the code of the biggest protocols: Uniswap, AAVE, etc Rust path:   \\u2022 This one is hard, as I don\'t have Solana Seniors, lol   \\u2022 Can be better for US-based, as Solana is US-based and has different events   \\u2022 Just go to Solana website and seek for tasks and opportunities   \\u2022 Simply learn Rust via any online course and start doing something   \\u2022 If Solana - learn and understand the architecture specifics of accounts and try something only after that   \\u2022 Rust is not only for Solana, so feel free to explore Other ways:   \\u2022 You can learn Move as language and check Movement, Aptos, Sui   \\u2022 You can learn TypeScript and move forward with that   \\u2022 You can go the ZKP path if you like math and cryptography - check for ZKP libs + Noir from Aztec and Cairo from Starknet for advanced   \\u2022 Backend - GO. That\'s all here) Both Dev and Non-Dev path needs a lot of own research. As the main point here - try to understand the stuff you like, as maybe you don\'t need much of the above and still can be in Web3 - some DePIN cases For non-dev, you can check for Investment Analyst, Marketing Specialist and Project/Product Manager - my top picks In case you need something on top - feel free to let me know. will share more\\n| kristianism (1 upvotes): Have you tried connecting with other developers and maybe start something small?\\n| | devilxor4444 (1 upvotes): I don\'t really know where to contact other devs\\n| | | Jetter91 (2 upvotes): Depending on the Ecosystem, there are local communities  For Solana - Superteam in different countries For Ethereum - a lot of ETH communities and hackathons   Also, L2s have their own acceleration programs, so it depends on the points you are looking for And more\\n| | | | devilxor4444 (1 upvotes): Thankss I have been checking some out now\\n| | | kristianism (1 upvotes): Try starting at r/CryptoDevs also join their discord channel.

Specifically deep-learning techniques like alphafold use have millions of inputs and thus take 10x the time to generate a ZKP proof then the protein prediction. However, your specific problem of protein prediction has the benefit having super fast validation of correct calculations without having to repeat the calculations or even rely on ZKP, such as verify bond lengths, angles, and steric clashes using molecular physics rules and many other checks.       PS I am not an expert in protein prediction the least bit and use AI to help my understanding of what type of outputs a successful protein prediction would give in order to understand if blockchain would be a good fit.\\n| | | | Jetter91 (1 upvotes): Same, on my end, not a bioinformatician But there are always 2 options on working with such data - security or informed consent On the end of FHE though - why it can be slow, not an open problem if you understand it - have a couple of friends working with that rn +with the expansion of agentic-driven economies TEE may be enough for that case in some cases But once again - really depends on the details\\n| xsinxxxx (1 upvotes): Hey there, I am also from Pakistan, do let me know when you start building your communities I would love to be a part and even be a moderator!

Web1 was decentralized. Web2 was centralization largely to social media companies like google and meta. Web3 will be decentralization via blockchain technology.  Blockchain has countless applications, from healthcare, voting, supply chain management, farming, etc.\\n| Fit-Repair-4556 (2 upvotes): Privacy, freedom of speech, and ownership would be important offerings by web3. But I don\\u2019t think they are too important for people right now, hence the lack of adoption.\\n| | OstrichRealistic5033 (3 upvotes): >But I don\\u2019t think they are too important for people right now, hence the lack of adoption. It is really important to people that understand the pros and cons of data privacy which is why several people are migrating to Decentralised Social (DeSoc) platforms like Bluesky and MeWe (FYI, over 1 million users MeWe now on-chain adoption web3 solution for privacy and ownership sake)\\n| | resornihgp (2 upvotes): Have you heard about DePIN? I\'d suggest you explore this area of Web3. It defines the core value and intention of Web3 to a large extent compared to other areas. On Peaq, you will find tons of them with different real-life applications covering diverse niche.\\n| | | Lumpy-Engineering900 (1 upvotes): Thanks, I\\u2019ve read about DePin, really interesting, what i was looking for. do you think I can rent my computational power for earning some money? How does it work? Are there people doing it?\\n| | | | resornihgp (1 upvotes): I don\'t think some projects permit sharing your computational power. You can start with a few that don\'t necessarily need any physical devices to set up before earning\\u2014just downloading an extension or app. Also, I\'d suggest you explore Peaq\'s Get Real campaign as well. S2 start soon.\\n| Xperienceizzles (2 upvotes): It not just about substitution, but about putting the users first. Web3 socials will take over web2 because of users will be in control, which is what every social Media user wants. Good thing that we have protocols like Frequency that makes it more interesting, by supporting decentralized social media, providing the infrastructure for users to own and control their data and digital identity. This here is the furry and everyone will get on board soon.\\n| AssetMantleAdmin (2 upvotes): Hey there,I\\u2019ll break this down for you in a straightforward way      Web3 is essentially the next evolution of the internet, moving away from the centralized control of Web2\\u2014think of today\\u2019s social media platforms or big tech companies that hold all the power      Web3 uses blockchain technology to decentralize things, giving users more control over their data and online interactions      It\\u2019s like shifting from renting an apartment (Web2, where you\\u2019re at the mercy of the landlord) to owning your own house (Web3, where you make the rules)      The substitution won\\u2019t happen overnight. It\\u2019ll be gradual, as Web3 applications become more user-friendly and accessible      Right now, Web2 dominates daily activities like social media scrolling or online shopping because it\\u2019s familiar and convenient. But Web3 can replace these by offering alternatives where you\\u2019re not just a user but a stakeholder      For example, instead of a platform like Instagram owning your content and data, a Web3 version might let you own your digital identity and earn tokens for your contributions (psssssst at AssetMantle we are working on this exact same thing check us out https://assetmantle.one)      As for the main application of Web3 for the general population, I\\u2019d point to decentralized social platforms or community-driven marketplaces      Imagine a social media app where you\\u2019re not bombarded with ads, your data isn\\u2019t sold, and you can earn rewards for creating content\\u2014or a marketplace where you buy directly from creators without a middleman taking a huge cut.      These could integrate into daily life by offering better privacy, fairness, and even financial incentives.      That\\u2019s my take!\\n| | Lumpy-Engineering900 (1 upvotes): Thanks a lot! To you but also to all the people that spent their time in explaining it to me! Really appreciate it. So, on top of that, do you think the platforms will be as user friendly as those that we daily use for our activities. (Eg social media or cloud etc centralized)?? Because it seems (from my close minded point of view) that all this stuff are just for technical people. Like those already capable with computers. Not like for everyone\\n| | | AssetMantleAdmin (1 upvotes): Absolutely! The key to making Web3 platforms mainstream is bridging the gap between blockchain\\u2019s powerful features and the seamless user experience of Web2. The most scalable crypto products will be those that retain Web3\\u2019s core benefits i.e. ownership, decentralization, and incentives while feeling as intuitive as the platforms people already use daily Think about how most people don\\u2019t need to understand TCP/IP to browse the internet, Web3 should be the same. The best projects are focusing on Web2-native UI/UX with Web3 infrastructure under the hood. Things like social logins (instead of complex wallet setups), gasless transactions, and simple onboarding will be game-changers Imagine opening a social app that looks and feels just like Instagram or Twitter, but without intrusive ads, data harvesting, or a central authority deciding what you see. You wouldn\\u2019t notice any difference in how you interact - posting, liking, and sharing but in the background, your content belongs to you, your engagement earns you rewards, and no company can de-platform you overnight. The experience remains frictionless, but the incentives and control shift in favor of the user The goal isn\\u2019t just to appeal to hardcore crypto users but to create something that feels as easy as Instagram or Amazon, just with added ownership and financial benefits.       That\\u2019s how real adoption happens\\n| stuphs (2 upvotes): Web3 won\\u2019t replace Web2 overnight, but it will reshape key areas like social media, identity, and finance. One of the biggest shifts is decentralized social, where users own their data instead of big tech. Take Frequency, for example\\u2014it\\u2019s building decentralized identity solutions that could power platforms like MeWe and even TikTok, giving users control over their online presence.\\n| oracleifi (2 upvotes): Web3 isn\\u2019t just about replacing Web2; it\\u2019s about decentralizing the internet to give users control. While social media might take time, sectors like finance, mobility, and infrastructure are already shifting. peaq is leading this with DePIN, powering real-world decentralized applications from shared mobility to AI-driven networks. If you want to research Web3\\u2019s real-world impact, that\\u2019s a great place to start.\\n| Extent_Leather (2 upvotes): The biggest shift Web3 will bring is ownership. In Web2, companies own everything, your data, your posts, even your social media accounts. With Web3, you control your digital identity, which is why projects like Frequency are important for secure, user-owned online interactions.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/1jadc2s'}, {'title': 'Decentralized Web Innovations and Future Internet Applications', 'text': '{"text":"Title: Depin!

Both are disrupting industries in different ways.

You just said blockchain is \\"changing how we handle trust, ownership, and decentralization\\" and yet these entities are at a much higher level within the whole system and can even disrupt \\"how we process data, automate tasks, and make decisions\\" much more, not the other way around. Take note that AI has a higher chance to reach its peak data capacity that is almost impossible to happen with blockchain, given that you increase the energy production for running AI and blockchain separately.\\n| Internal_West_3833 (1 upvotes): Sounds amazing in theory, but I wonder how it would handle scalability and user-friendliness. People are so used to the convenience of centralized platforms, would they actually switch.?\\n| | Maleficent_Apple_287 (1 upvotes): Decentralization sounds great, but the reality is that most people just want things to work easily. Right now, blockchain-based platforms still have a long way to go in terms of user experience and scalability. Gas fees, slow transactions, and complicated wallet setups turn a lot of people off. That said, innovation happens fast. We\\u2019ve seen how crypto wallets, Layer 2 solutions, and better UX designs are making things smoother. If decentralized platforms can match the convenience of Web2 while offering real ownership and privacy, people *will* switch, maybe not all at once, but gradually. It\\u2019s less about replacing the internet overnight and more about giving users better options over time.\\n| Xperienceizzles (1 upvotes): A blockchain powered web will be insane for real, and great too. This is mainly needed in the social media space, considering how badly these centralized bodies are using our datas. It\\u2019s great that projects like Frequency stepped to the fore with a chain that creates the infrastructure for users to own and control their data and identity on decentralized social media platforms, but an all round blockchain powered web will be out of their world for real.\\n| fxhst329 (1 upvotes): it has a lot of potential and makes a lot more sense than many current systems. what is missing is proper infrastructure, but its being built..takes time to rebuild everything different way, but its happening and things will be changing gradually\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/1j7v7yi'}]
