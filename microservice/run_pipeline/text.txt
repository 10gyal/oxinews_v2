This post is not to brag, it is to let remind everyone here to not give up!  Quantity: I estimate that applied to over 250+ jobs\\u2014some of which I wasn\\u2019t even sure I wanted, but I felt desperate to leave where I was. Applying for jobs is 50% luck, 50% resume. Look in the market every.day. Opportunities will be uploaded daily/weekly, and you need to be one of the first resumes in to even have a chance.  Resume: Tailor your resumes! Understand where you want to be in your industry and have about 5 generic resumes ready that can be quickly tailored to the description. E.g, I had one for financial services, one for investment industry, one for accounting, etc that was each manipulated to the job I was applying for. Have a neat and concise resume. Highly your achievements and look beyond your professional roles. E.g I included a section of a club I was a part of and featured it as if it was a job. Interviews: PREP! I used ChatGBT to provide behavioral, situational, and technical questions that were both generic and industry specific. Have your stories implanted in your head. 1 story can be altered to answer different questions.  Where to look: as a student, I had access to platforms beyond LinkedIn and indeed. There are search engines that will populate job opportunities found through the web. Reach out to your schools career services to ask if they have any deals with handshake, etc. ALSO, look at company website career sections weekly! Have your target companies listed in a spreadsheet. DISCLOSURE, for those who read this, my school had a hidden secret: careershift. This website is a search engine that pulls opportunities for all over the web. USE IT. I found my job through this\\u2014I don\\u2019t know I would have ever found it if I didn\\u2019t use it.. Be prepared for rejection! My heart was broken so many times by companies choosing other candidates when I was SO close. IT WILL work out in the end\\u2014just don\\u2019t give up!  Feel free to ask any questions! Good luck!\\n\\n11 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was common for me to prepare for interviews on the school shuttle bus or skip dinner to finish an assessment. My long job search journey can be broken down into three phases: **1\\ufe0f\\u20e3** No Direction (March 2024 \\u2013 August 2024) 1,300+ applications, 5 interview invitations from fake or small-sized companies.I even attended an information session where all the participants were old grandma and grandpa. **2\\ufe0f\\u20e3** Adjustment (September 2024 \\u2013 October 2024) Stopped applying and reflected on my mistakes.Realized I had wasted time on ineffective efforts: no polished resumes, no refined interview skills.Created 6 versions of my resume tailored to different job roles. **3\\ufe0f\\u20e3** Apply! Practice! Refine! (November 2024 \\u2013 March 2025) 500+ applications, 23 interviews. Polished my interview answers daily using ChatGPT until it achieved full memory. Visited mock interview websites more frequently than Tiktok. Revised my resume sentence by sentence. Even dreamed about practicing behavioral questions in my sleep. Finally, I made it. Here are the tools I used after adjusting my strategy, hope this helps someone struggling! \\u2705 **Job Application Websites:** [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/): Better for mid and small-sized companies, ideal for students seeking internships or entry-level roles. [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/): Where I got my first internship. A reliable platform connected to universities with up-to-date job postings. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/): More suitable for applying to larger companies than Indeed. \\u2705 **Interview Preparation Websites:** [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/): Offers real interview experiences and company reviews from past candidates and employees. Also provides job market insights worth reading. [AMA Interview](https://www.amainterview.ai/): Mock interviews with an AI avatar. Helped me refine my speaking speed, gestures, and answers through real-time feedback. I felt proud when I finally received a high score from my robot interview coach lol. \\u2705 **Resume Revision Websites:** [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/): Provides tailored resume suggestions based on job descriptions, work experience, and projects. [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/): Offers more detailed and comprehensive feedback than ChatGPT, though slightly slower in response time.I lost count of how many rejection letters I received, but they never stopped me from applying for the next job. The most valuable lesson I learned from my hundreds of sleepless nights is this:   A smarter strategy is more important than the number of applications.Landing a job is becoming increasingly difficult. If you\'re struggling, know that it\\u2019s not your fault in this job market. 1956 applications, 1900+ rejections, 28 interviews, 1 offer. If I can do it, so can you.\\n\\n46 Comments:\\n--------\\n| aquila399 (59 upvotes): DAMN man....you must be the most patient and determined guy in the world lol. Thanks for the suggestions and sources.\\n| Boring-Win2469 (36 upvotes): So happy for you and kudos to your hard work, but job search shouldn\'t be this painful. This economy has literally doomed our generation.  It\'s sad that even in dreams we have to practice behaviour questions.\\n| HatoriiHanzo (15 upvotes): No one should have to go through any of this for a job. Happy for you op.\\n| Welcome2frightnight (8 upvotes): Bro, if that\\u2019s what it takes now to get a job, it\\u2019s easier to be the weed man.\\n| jhkoenig (13 upvotes): So it seems that you are a VERY big fan of AMA Interview. Are you a founder? Almost all of your posts mention it.\\n| | butsallycantwait (6 upvotes): Emm man if I were the founder whether it meant I could use it for free\\u2026 that would be nice. I just want to share my experience to help others avoid going down the wrong path. It\\u2019s unfair to misunderstand my intentions. Hopefully they see my posts and pay for me\\u2026\\ud83d\\ude02\\n| | ResplendentPius194 (1 upvotes): Really? How did you figure it out?\\n| devils-dadvocate (10 upvotes): How the Hell are you guys putting in 1000+ applications? Is it just purely spamming them? Less is more with applications. Look for a good fit and put effort into it. Time spent on an obvious no is time wasted.\\n| | fjaoaoaoao (5 upvotes): Speaking more generally, many obvious \\"no\\"s are not so obvious to the applicant. Also, someone could also apply to many things they are appropriately or overqualified for but just not be the type of person a company wants.\\n| | | devils-dadvocate (1 upvotes): Yeah, I understand that some might not be obvious \\u201cno\\u2019s\\u201d to the applicant. But this guy said he put in 1300+ applications in the first 5 months and got 5 interviews. That\\u2019s a lot of time wasted. I imagine he would have better luck putting in 100 applications that he really researched and spent time on.\\n| | dont-need-to-nose (4 upvotes): I once applied to over 70 jobs in one day. 4 hours during the day then I went to a restaurant got drunk came home and applied to jobs for another 4 hours from 12am to 4am. I just received a job offer from on of those 2am applications on Tuesday, and I start April 1st. You can apply to manyyyyy jobs if you want to. Just about time and efforts. Good luck if you\\u2019re searching\\n| | | devils-dadvocate (1 upvotes): That\\u2019s crazy, but congrats, lol. Thankfully I started a couple of weeks ago. I put in I guess 8-10 applications, but I spent a lot of time looking for the right places. Got 4 interviews and 2 offers, but it did take a few months.\\n| | | | dont-need-to-nose (4 upvotes): Congrats!  It took me about two months. Redid my CV 3 times.  You are very correct about not putting in effort for jobs that aren\\u2019t a great fit , because I ended up getting an offer for a separate role that I rejected because I didn\\u2019t really like what the job entailed.  But managed to get the offer I accepted four days later so it all worked out lol. Cheers to having money in our bank accounts each month now! \\ud83e\\udd23 I hope your role treats you well :)\\n| | Necessary-River-5724 (0 upvotes): From the looks of things, OP is just straight up lying.   When you look at his posts its his own site and hes advertising it by pretending to be a user of it.  And when you go to site, he is lying there too \\ud83e\\udd23 says 3000+ successful interviews, but website was only made in 2 months ago. OP, may I suggest that deceipt is not a strong foundation to start your company upon.  I\'d also suggest you brush up on your technical skills rather than lying to people.  This website looks very poor on mobile \\ud83d\\udc40\\ud83d\\ude42\\n| Visible-Mess-2375 (20 upvotes): Not really anything groundbreaking here. I\\u2019ve done all these same things and here I am still unemployed 18 months and 2500+ applications later.  So I would tone down the \\u201cif I can do it, you can do it\\u201d rhetoric because there are those of us who will never succeed no matter how many adjustments we make. There are just too many jobseekers and not enough good jobs to go around. But that aside, congrats. Good for you.\\n| | Unplannedroute (3 upvotes): Have you skipped dinners tho? \\ud83d\\ude09\\n| | | Visible-Mess-2375 (2 upvotes): Just entered that phase\\n| | | | Unplannedroute (1 upvotes): Looking good then. Won\'t be long til you get a offer.\\n| | | | | Visible-Mess-2375 (1 upvotes): Doubtful\\n| | Affectionate_Cut_835 (1 upvotes): Because you have to lower your expectations. You will probably be poor while working. But you will have a job.\\n| | | Visible-Mess-2375 (1 upvotes): Already tried that. I can\\u2019t even get into McDonald\\u2019s or Taco Bell\\n| | | | Affectionate_Cut_835 (0 upvotes): You\'re doing something wrong, I am really really sorry. I remember giving up after having sent 10 resumes.  You have given up 15 month ago. There is 0 reason for you not to be able to work in HR, or as a Servise advisor in a car rental, or as a warehouse operator, or as a customer servise agent. 0 reasons!  If you feel like you are over-qualified for the job you are applying to, MAKE UP YOUR RESUME COMPLETELY! I did it as well. Nobody will be looking into it. (I am sorry, I am not an native English speaker ... )\\n| OkPerspective2465 (3 upvotes): If anything it kinda shows that the ai assistants aren\'t all that if they only got 1 interview. Though we\'d need more data on how many revisions,\\u00a0 tweaks and prompts.\\n| | Necessary-River-5724 (2 upvotes): Hes lying to sell his interview site.  His comment history is filled with lies just like his website, where it claims to have \\"aced 300k interviews\\" but the website was only registered in january this year\\n| South_Ant_3370 (2 upvotes): mad respect.\\n| marketing_techy (2 upvotes): Did you take the offer and was it a good one??\\n| Cryptoneering (2 upvotes): How many years of experience? Did you have any known brand companies or recognizable? How many years per role on your resume? Some context that would help thanks\\n| famouscookiecutter (2 upvotes): GOAT stuff and good luck on your first week \\ud83d\\ude03\\n| Beautiful_Hedgehog47 (2 upvotes): Congrats!\\n| Tron-Velodrome (2 upvotes): Whatever it is, you deserve that job!!\\n| hereFromSomewhere (2 upvotes): Thanks your story gives me some hope !\\n| thinkscience (2 upvotes): All the best\\u00a0\\n| Man_on_the_moon36 (2 upvotes): Thank for the info but did you end up with the job offered\\n| sahildeep011 (2 upvotes): Woah thank you so much. It was much needed for me to understand as I left my job last Friday without having an offer letter in hand. Now I\'m looking for a new job.\\n| | TheGratitudeBot (3 upvotes): Thanks for saying thanks! It\'s so nice to see Redditors being grateful :)\\n| usernames_suck_ok (4 upvotes): Thanks for mentioning the AMA Interview tool. What kinds of jobs were you trying to get (i.e. field, remote)?\\n| | Necessary-River-5724 (2 upvotes): He owns the site and is using deceipt to try and gain users.   Not only does he lie here about doing so many interviews,  but he also lies on his website where he claimsto have gotten 2500+ offers and 300k+ interviews aced (within 2 months of his website being open).

Boom, your resume is in front of their HR department and you didn\'t have to write a cover letter. After this legit happened to me twice in a row and both times I ended up getting a positive response to my direct HR email within 24 hrs, I started doing it for every application. If you\'re truly a strong candidate for the job they\'ll be glad to hear from you, and these kinds of online form errors really do happen often enough.  You can look up HR people for many companies on LinkedIn and many have their email addresses listed, but you can also just blanket-send to a bunch of the typical catch-all email addresses (hr@ company name dot com, careers@, recruitment@, jobs@, etc.). Most will get kicked back as nonexistent addresses but at least one should get through for each company, and you may even get bonus points for tenacity in taking the extra step of trying to contact HR directly with a white hat email hack. To prep for the interview, ask an AI what the 10 most common job interview questions are for \\\\[job title\\\\] in \\\\[your country\\\\] and make sure you\'re prepared to answer them all. For huge conglomerates like Microsoft you can ask an AI for the 10 most common questions for that job in that company. In your answers, be prepared to use examples from the job history on your resume - to map your responses directly to your experience. Research the company and be prepared to answer the question of why you want to work for that company specifically, I\'ve been asked this in every interview. Create abbreviated cheat sheets of these questions and answers. To prep for the video interview, set up cheat sheets all around your monitor in large print. Tape \'em to ladders, lamp poles, furniture, walls...whatever you have to do so you can keep your eyes forward during the interview and still be able to quickly glance at your notes. Video interviews are like open book tests when you do this.      To prep harder for the interview (and in this market you should), whether for video or in person, as soon as you know the names of the interviewers look them up on LinkedIn and online in general. Read their bios, skim any of their blog posts, see what tools they\'re using in their work, check out any personal sites they have so you can work shared interests, common past geography, experiences or education, etc. into the discussion to create rapport that\'s instant and memorable for the interviewer. If you end up being co workers this stuff would eventually come up anyway so IMO it\'s not fake or manipulative.  Good luck, everyone. \\n\\n13 Comments:\\n--------\\n| Interesting_Wolf_668 (26 upvotes): I expected you to give us the equivalent of \\u2018try turning it on and off again\\u2019 job advice - you know, \\u2018be the first to apply, don\\u2019t send your CV with pink titles, etc.\\u2019 Your advice is actually pretty original. A little bit of \\u2018Jesus Christ it\\u2019s Jason Bourne\\u2019 - but the good kind. Because now days landing an interview does feel like a Hollywood action movie except the good guy can\\u2019t actually get hired to fight crime. Anyways, thanks for this.\\n| jhkoenig (11 upvotes): Congratulations! Sounds like your hard work and preparation really paid off.\\n| Inevitable_Trip_7480 (7 upvotes): Pretty accurate to what I\\u2019ve recently found out. Wish I woulda known this years ago. If I can\\u2019t find an email to the hiring manager/recruiter I don\\u2019t even apply anymore. I might be missing out on some opportunities out there but my responses back and interviews skyrocketed. As for the interview prep. Yeah, you pretty much need to be a mid-level stalker.

They asked me what I would need as a salary and I gave them a pretty crazy number. They accepted and extended the offer. Since we don\\u2019t have kids, we decided that we would purchase a second home in the city where I will be working. Husband will live there a few days a week and at the house we have now the other days. Granted, it\\u2019s a bit more expensive to maintain two houses but we\\u2019d plan to sell the one in my job area when I retire. I realized that it\\u2019s worth my sanity to move out of my current job and now I\\u2019ll be making $50k a year more than I was making before. I thought I should be loyal to my company but now I realize the only way to really get a raise is to move to a new company.

I should add that my new job is in a very touristy area that has a lot of features that we like. We had been considering buying a second home in that area for a while and now is the time.

On my resume, I had Software Engineering experience and Test Engineering experience, and was hoping to go more towards an engineering role + closer to 100k salary, but given how bad the tech job market is right now, I felt the need to accept the offer.

I\\u2019m hoping this role will get me solid foundation on Linux/UNIX\\n| | | | | AnnyuiN (1 upvotes): Linux knowledge is important IMO and not enough developers are proficient with it. It\'s astounding the lack of even basic computer knowledge some developers have. Many can\'t even solve basic issues with VSCode let alone Linux issues.. definitely study up on Linux. Then learn python and then Ansible. Just those skillsets alone are worth 6 figures and will play a giant role in your career path.\\n| MightGuy8Gates (1 upvotes): Take the job for the experience, apply while working.  I took a job with my masters in data science similar in pay because I couldn\\u2019t land anything even with connections and applications.  Like others told me, good to have something on the resume + experience in a weird market.\\n| QuesoMeHungry (1 upvotes): Take the job, tech jobs are in a bad spot right now, if you have an offer in hand I\\u2019d be all in. 64k is fine for a new grad.  If the IT job doesn\\u2019t have any coding, my tip is keep doing development work on the side either for fun or for misc projects because if you don\\u2019t use it, you\\u2019ll lose it. I did this and took a job that didn\\u2019t have any coding for like 10 years and I\\u2019m having to teach myself again to get a new job because every job seems to have an interview coding test now.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jbzg47'}]

I give up. I\\u2019m going to start deleting my indeed account, LinkedIn, blocking recruiters and deleting agency accounts. I did everything I was told to do. I worked in high school (not a lot compared to many people but I still did). Went to college, I was told to get a white collar office job, a degree didn\\u2019t matter so I studied something that I liked studying; history. Is this what doomed me? I was told to get involved with student organizations. Became secretary of one and financial officer of another.  I was told to get internships. I couldn\\u2019t\\u2026 is this what doomed me? They were incredibly competitive. I tried all three years I was in school and I was never able to land one. Many of them required experience which is odd.  I was told to network on LinkedIn. Everyone, and I mean everyone ghosts me.  I\\u2019ve applied to over 350 different positions since December and I have gotten NO interviews. No offers. Even getting a rejection email is a luxury. It\\u2019s as if they see my name and throw it in the trash before reading my resume.  I was told to use a specific resume format. Did that. Have a \\u201cmaster\\u201d resume that I can edit to fit the current application. Did that. Still nothing.  I don\\u2019t know what else I\\u2019m supposed to do. I\\u2019ve looked at temp agencies and I\\u2019ve gotten no matches there. I\\u2019m not even applying for careers anymore. Damn Walmart and wing stop won\\u2019t even look at me.  Education counts as experience so technically I have multiple years of experience in some fields right? I can stretch things right? Doesn\\u2019t matter, I still get nothing.  Entry level jobs required 2-3 years experience usually and some even have 5!! 5 years! Does that not warrant a promotion??  I network with my friends and I get referrals and that doesn\\u2019t work.  I see brilliant people struggling in the job market. People who already worked and got laid off, people with masters degrees or PhDs and they\\u2019re struggling. So how is this going to possible for an average-below average person like me? People say to volunteer to get experience but applications require experience in THAT position, there\\u2019s no just \\u201cexperience\\u201d. The job market has completely convinced me that I am unwanted in this current market. Fine I give up. I don\\u2019t know what to do when I have to start paying my student loans when my grace period ends but I\\u2019ll play by ear.  \\n\\n315 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But the nail in the coffin for new grads is a lack of work experience. That experience could be in the form of internships or part-time jobs where they do something more valuable than data entry.

The travel agent industry weirdly seems to be booming rn, so if you want to write this book, get into that field, develop Japan as your niche, build a following on social as an expert on tourism in Japan for history-oriented folks, and then once you\\u2019ve hit five figures of followers, that\\u2019s when you write your book proposal and start making lists of lit agents.\\n| | Minimum-City-7293 (6 upvotes): If you got your teaching credentials you could teach high school.\\n| | | agoldgold (5 upvotes): History teachers are generally also coaches, so it\'s a competitive job comparatively.\\n| | | | historicityWAT (1 upvotes): \\u26b0\\ufe0f\\u26b0\\ufe0f\\u26b0\\ufe0f\\n| | | historicityWAT (1 upvotes): Would interfere with my book promo\\n| | Highly-Aggressive (1 upvotes): Damn\\n| | gowithflow192 (1 upvotes): Two completely opposite fields, why?\\n| | | historicityWAT (1 upvotes): Are you referring to my undergrad or graduate work?\\n| | | | gowithflow192 (1 upvotes): My mistake, sorry.

I understand that it might not pay much up front, which is why you might want to keep searching for a job.

Then the more i moved up the ladder the more I realised senior management of every single Australian company are made of middle aged white men that wanted to mandate return to office. They all have investment properties while us white collars just want to live a simple life with our families. Fuck them, their boomer entitlement and third grade education. Pisses me off that the younger generation, despite being much more well educated and diverse, is treated with contempt and disrespect. The system is rigged, so play with the loopholes and fuck them at their games.\\n| | BeSmarter2022 (2 upvotes): You must not read all of the people on here are trying to backtrack when they lie when they actually get a job.

And for most people, no matter how hyper social you are, that\'s maybe 50 people maximum that trust you in that way. So not a huge number of opportunities that can stem from that when half the companies aren\'t hiring, and those that are may not be hiring your skill set. I say this because I have a lot of people reach out to me to join the company I work for and I really do not know them well enough to meaningfully refer them, which gives them very little momentum even when I stick my neck out.\\n| | | Snoo_37569 (1 upvotes): Talking more about interviewing you got to manipulate the process, find these goons who you\\u2019re interviewing with online find out their life story and interests, in the interview stear conversation away from the job they already know you can do and make yourself relatable with some good ol schmoozing, works like a charm\\n| | | | jjopm (1 upvotes): It doesn\'t hurt. But for tech roles you have to go through the same interview process as everyone else once you build rapport in the first few minutes.

My opinion is to leave it on your resume to shut any skeptical recruiters up who might doubt you meet the cutoff if you omit it. But beef up your strengths instead. GPA is not the only metric to compete on. It not even the most meaningful metric, but I understand the bullshit some employers put new grads through. You never hear about experienced hires being evaluated by tenths of a decimal point following some number.\\n| | NorthLibertyTroll (2 upvotes): Colleges and career councilors say degrees don\'t matter.\\n| | | Billy-BigBollox (2 upvotes): The type of degree doesn\'t matter, but having one does to some extent. My degree is in audio engineering, but I\'m an analyst at a Fortune 500 company.\\n| | | TangerineBand (1 upvotes): So here\'s the thing with degrees. It doesn\'t teach you the exact skills you need, But a generalized knowledge still helps you out immensely. Plus there\'s a more cynical side to it. You might not necessarily \\"need\\" it to do the job, but you\'re not getting past the application filter without it. I\'m aware that\'s area dependent but it does open doors.\\n| | oftcenter (1 upvotes): >Whoever said degree doesn\\u2019t matter, lied to you. Big time. I call this \\"The Most Dangerous Lie Ever Told\\" lol. It comes with huge caveats that are usually omitted by the person telling it.  And it\'s also aging; employers demand specialization now more than ever before. Even entry level candidates are being asked to prove three years of experience in a specific field.\\n| TheRupertBear (19 upvotes): Hey man. I went to college and majored in philosophy and got a minor in finance. I was an active member of the Student Finance Association and the Pre-Law Association at my school. I worked in the substance abuse field as a tech while I was in school and later worked as a counselor out of school. I volunteered as a treasurer for a California state convention aimed towards keeping the youth off drugs and alcohol.       I am currently looking to change fields at 35 years old because I got tired of making $23/hour and being treated like garbage by my clients and my boss and society. I am having very little luck. Something I can say for you and your job search is this: virtually every job I got was due to befriending someone and them finding out I was looking for work. My most recent position as a counselor was had because I was selling my kayak on Facebook Marketplace. The guy who came to buy it saw my degrees on the wall and asked what I did for work. I told him my history and he asked if I thought about working in that field again. I was a shoe in for the job because that guy was a 72 year old man who happened to be THE advisor for the region of the state I was in.  Nepotism is how jobs are got. People will cry online, but at the same time, those same people are largely only online. I am looking to change careers at the moment and have found that HR people are quite ridiculous in that they are not informed and are unaware. Think of the girls who majored in HR and communication. That is your gatekeeper. I am making efforts to reach out directly to people that make the end decision at companies I think would be good for me.  Don\'t give up, just change strategies and think like an elder gen-x/boomer would because that is who your boss is going to be\\n| | babbling_homunculus (3 upvotes): >My most recent position as a counselor was had because I was selling my kayak on Facebook Marketplace.

It\'s networking. Nepotism would be that man reserving a job in the company for his nephew. Nepotism is a huge problem, but it doesn\'t help us to conflate it with networking. It muddies the waters in these discussions.\\n| BuyHigh_S3llLow (23 upvotes): I doubt your history major is the reason. Alot of people who worked in tech grinder really hard and are amongst the brighter/educated demographic of society are laid off with multiple years of experience and can\'t find jobs.

Look into some kind of class or way to practice presenting, it helped me a ton in carrying myself better in front of others and could be a big help to you as well.\\n| | Bullishbear99 (2 upvotes): I think what lures people into the field is that they think they will be the next shelby foote, or any number of the big Youtuber history channels.  You usually end up teaching high school or college.\\n| | | oftcenter (1 upvotes): Or they want to study something that doesn\'t make them miserable.  The average degree program is 40 classes. It\'s not reasonable to ask someone to sit through AND PASS 40 classes of progressive difficulty in a field they\'re fundamentally disinterested in. And if the material doesn\'t suit their natural style of thinking, good God. For 4+ years. That\'s a lot to ask of someone.  And it\'s not going to end after graduation either. Because the whole appeal of specialized, \\"practical\\" degrees is their applicability to specific jobs. But if you hate the field you\'re studying, you\'re not going to like the jobs in that field! So that major set you up for a path you don\'t want to be on -- at the expense of preparing you for the path you *actually* wanted to pursue. So they\'ll be in debt, burnt out, unemployed, and not skilled enough to be employed in either field. They\'ll have the worst of both worlds.\\n| LoaderD (4 upvotes): Post your resume on Reddit for a review and give some examples of closed postings you applied for.

I was in your EXACT same situation and it was at the moment that I finally told myself I give up that released some sort of weird energy into the universe and then ended up getting employed within 2 weeks later. I can\\u2019t really explain it but all I can say to you is this, stop worrying, stop stressing, stop overthinking, and give yourself simply 1 single day to genuinely relax and feel peace. In that time remind yourself of the true value and asset you are to any company and any team in the world. You have everything that it takes to become successful. And you will be. But nothing great can happen without true struggle. Your time is coming and it\\u2019s just around the corner. Don\\u2019t stress it. Trust me \\u2026 it\\u2019ll help you secure a job when your being interviewed when your not thinking about how desperately you need a job. Visualize yourself already having a job and truly embody that vision. You won\\u2019t hurt yourself by doing that, it\\u2019s the first step into manifesting. You won\\u2019t get what you want if your constantly in a state of insecurity, fear, uncertainty, unhappiness, doubt, etc. you have to remind yourself of who you really are and what you actually bring to the table. And focus on that energy when your interviewing and I promise the universe will handle the rest for you. Keep an open minded spirit and don\\u2019t allow your thoughts to limit your potential. Good luck friend\\n| mr-pixelkiller (2 upvotes): First and foremost, I\\u2019ve been in this situation a few times in mid-career and it sucks. For those just starting out, it\\u2019s even harder. The best advice I can give anyone at this point is to not take it personally and just do your best to accomplish what need/want. There is only so much you can control, and you need to accept that.  Thankfully, I landed a 6 month contract recently that I\\u2019m in the early stage of. But I have still been speculating the market in the job boards and I\\u2019m prepared to start the hustle of applying and interviewing once again. But at least this time I have income to depend on at the moment. I know what it\\u2019s like to be financially devastated and the stress that comes along with it, so I truly empathize with people who work hard to achieve what they need and desire, but live on the fringes of society and struggle to make ends meet.  I just focus on what I can control, my attitude, my health, my skills to pay the bills. I just try to live a good lifestyle and do my best to be my best. Eventually I\\u2019ll find the right tribe.

I search up the people who are \\"more qualified\\" than me. The answer is always either nepotism hire, or a seasoned 5+ year exp professional beating me out for a junior level position asking for 2-4 years exp.

It\\u2019s a good one, though a little out of my comfort zone, and I have hope that it will be a long-term fit.

Good luck.\\n| Bees__Khees (2 upvotes): You majored in History. Sucks but reality is that degree isn\\u2019t in demand.

Try to keep your head up high please and remain social when out and about because you never know what job opportunities they can help you with. I know someone via a video game we both play, never even video called the dude but we talk often and have gotten to know each other well, I know various stuff about him and his family even and he let me know that if i live in pittbusrg ever that he\\u2019ll have a job for me\\n| | Powerful-Edge-9809 (6 upvotes): He didn\\u2019t turn down internships, he said he wasn\\u2019t able to land one\\n| | | Quick_Coyote_7649 (1 upvotes): Yeah my bad on that part\\n| | | | Powerful-Edge-9809 (2 upvotes): All good brotha!!\\n| espeero (3 upvotes): Yes.  The history degree doomed you.  Who in the world told you that the degree didn\'t matter? Jesus.  Anyway, it\'s not hopeless.  If you are a good worker, you can make a good career with any background for the simple reason that most workers are terrible. One of my good friends got a history degree.  He took a job with a rental car company.  Quickly worked his way up and now makes a damn good living.  If you are sharp, responsible, personable, you will stand out.  His story isn\'t unique at all.\\n| EarlyBrick3997 (4 upvotes): Dig deep in all the rabbit holes... I was laid off and found a job within 2 months.  I do not have an indeed account.

But please don\\u2019t give up. There\\u2019s a high chance that no human is even seeing your resume, and depending on the jobs you\\u2019re applying for, some companies are fielding 100s or even 1000s of applications right now. I actually wrote an article about this a few weeks back on how to get around the job search blackhole...you might find some useful insights in it since it\\u2019s based on my firsthand experience. If you\\u2019re interested...feel free to DM me, and I\\u2019d be happy to share the link (rest assured, I\\u2019m not selling a thing either). From what you\\u2019ve described, you\\u2019re already doing a lot of things right...but there are a few more strategies that could help you get seen and increase your chances. Also, while I\\u2019m in the tech profession, I\\u2019d be happy to take a look at your resume and give some feedback if that would be helpful. No pressure at all...just an offer if you feel like sharing. Hang in there...you\\u2019re not alone in this\\ud83d\\udcaa...for everybody...tech or no-tech is feeling the squeeze right now. Also, while I can\\u2019t speak for other sites, I\\u2019d really advise keeping your LinkedIn account, as it\'s what helped me land my last job. Obviously, you\\u2019re in a different field, but based on what I share in my piece, you can still leverage it in ways that might work for you too.\\n| lizabez4 (2 upvotes): I\'m going through the same thing and having the same exact thoughts, if anything helps me it\'s knowing I\'m not the only one in this position. I went on this subreddit to make a rant just like this only to see that someone else has already done it.

Only some form of socialism can save us now. it\'s best to let go of the idea of getting into tech in another developed country, rather I think it\'s much better to go to another country and to be open to hands on work, there you\'ll find more stability, better communities, and just overall lifestyle  You won\'t have the awesome technology, but that\'s worth it for me\\n| | | | | JustA_Song (1 upvotes): have you tried looking into teaching English as a second language? a few of my friends were placed in programs in Spain, Chile, Peru etc and get paid a decent wage to live and tutor in these countries (plus sunshine!)\\n| | Delicious-Ad-7016 (2 upvotes): Yes, to completely leave the rat race and the system, to start something new elsewhere, in an undeveloped country\\n| [deleted] (1 upvotes): [deleted]\\n| | IdontKnowAHHHH (1 upvotes): I\\u2019ve made dozens lol\\n| War_Recent (1 upvotes): You\\u2019re writing this like there\\u2019s an alternative route.

Because after applying for 1,000 corporate jobs every year I can\\u2019t find anything. I used referrals to get to third round sales interviews and they always fail. I even went 4 rounds to get rejected with the same copy paste email template. With the larger corporations you can\\u2019t even find out why, because there\\u2019s so many people you interact with that they ghost you and there\\u2019s no response. Dealerships at least you can walk in with your resume and speak with the GM like the old days. But there is no salary, and be prepared to work 60-80 hour workweeks to earn your paycheck. Also dealing with customers who are constantly angry at you burns you out after many years. But it\\u2019s the only industry that\\u2019s giving me a chance. I went into retail banking and it sucked. I am now in logistics, I\\u2019ve been at a few warehouses and delivery companies and it\\u2019s brutal physical labor for shit pay. No guarantee of hours. Toxic management. This job market sucks. Im now going back to school and will be finished with my bachelor\\u2019s in less than 3 months, And my plans are to start my master\\u2019s. But even then I know there\\u2019s no guarantee in my industry. I\\u2019ve tried other ones too, but no matter what it is\\u2026 it\\u2019s brutal.

Keeping ideas and topics together without run-on sentences is huge too!! 2. How to write an amazing resume!!!    3.  See about joining the Military Reserve\'s as an Officer and let them classify you but based on what you\'ve written on your education background, I highly recommend looking into becoming an Intelligence Officer or Cryptologist,!!!     You\'d probably love it and want to transition into an active duty billet!!!!!   The options would open up quickly for you if you did that!!!!   Id highly recommend the Navy and possibly teaching History at the Naval War College for starters too!!!! Ask for an age waiver too!!   Cryptologic Officers rarely go to sea either unless they choose a billet doing that Job!!! 4. Contact a local community college or larger college about being a substitute teacher which I bet could turn into a full time gig that pays damn well too!!!!

It usually doesn\'t matter what field or major you pick as long as you are in the top 1-5%.  For others, average folks like me, the options are limited to the fields that provide the max employment, usually the stem field with mostly computers nowadays and not the fields we are truly  passionate about. But don\'t lose hope. You are young. It\'ll be an extremely tough grind, but you\'ll make it if you are resilient.\\n| Every-Researcher9146 (1 upvotes): The issue is these folks NOT retiring, people in remote roles not giving them up and upper management trying to force all new roles/people back to the office. The market is flooded with over qualified applicants. There is a natural order to things and the system is effed. Employers can ask for ridiculous things right now, and pay less because they can. The pendulum will swing back the other way - it just takes time. Hang tight, it will. Right now is truly BRUTAL. In my current life: How can I become a director if every director role requires me to have already been one? The answer is the person clinging to their job who is well passed retirement age not vacating the position.

Plus using a computer and the Internet and software used in offices. Those are all solid transferable skills. I\\u2019m sorry it hasn\\u2019t resulted in a job offer for you.

If they ask you if you went to college say no. They will assume you are sure to be leaving soon for a better job and not hire you.

No person can stay sane while dealing with application after application followed by rejection after rejection (or ghosting!). Unfortunately it is not so simple to give up as a jib is basically a necessity. I hope you are just taking a break due to burnout. Finding a full time professional job is a job. It constantly weighs on your mind and you have to be in the lookout for opportunities. Based on what I see, schools are doing a horrendous job priming new grads for a job market that will have them competing with experienced applicants. Internships are so valuable but yet so difficult to obtain. I sincerely wish you the best. If you applied to a 1000 jobs then you are definitely putting in the effort, and that is all you can ask of yourself at this point.\\n| Redsfan19 (1 upvotes): You aren\\u2019t referring to your college years as experience in interviews and applications, are you?

I always wonder what people mean when they say that here. I hope you don\'t do anything drastic, I guess is what I\'m saying.  In any case, have you looked into weird private schools? Some will hire teachers without even a cert, as long as they have a bachelor\'s degree in the subject. I was looking at one a few days ago like this. Teaching fucking blows (I worked in education for ten years, so I\'m not just saying this) but going broke blows even more. Worst case scenario, look at your local hospitals if you haven\'t yet. They always have weird jobs available that you wouldn\'t expect, on their careers pages. I know healthcare is unrelated to history, but ehhh can\'t hurt to try. Beyond that, idk what to tell you. I got my degree in English a long long time ago, and it didn\'t really help me out either. I ended up substitute teaching for a while, and to get certified for that, all I needed was literally any four year degree. Once I got sick of subbing, I took a course, became a Certified Nursing Assistant, and went into that.\\n| Pilot-Signal (1 upvotes): 300+ applications and just got an interview. I hear you.

I\'ve had a lot of interviews but I\'m so jaded at this point like I already know I\'m not getting the job. I\'ve gotten rejections later in the day after my interview, and I didn\'t even give a bad interview or anything. I\'m so fucking sick of applying for jobs when nothing is going to come of it.\\n| dcporlando (1 upvotes): What caused your problem?   You didn\\u2019t stand out.   You worked some in high school, but not a lot.  You majored in something that no one cares about rather than a field that impacts your career.  Student organizations are great, if they relate to your field for work, otherwise they don\\u2019t help at all.  Internships are competitive but you didn\\u2019t stand out.   Education while important is not experience.   What can you do to stand out?   Keep applying and talk about what you can do for people.   Volunteer to gain experience.  Many organizations will be happy to have you help with almost anything.   Does your career field have certifications?   Get them.   When you apply, don\\u2019t do easy apply, really apply and make things specific for that company.   Networking on LinkedIn won\\u2019t get you far until you are above 500 connections.  Find people with the LION  tag or do the Saturday morning networking events to get lots of connections.  Once you do, post something of value, not just that you are looking for work.  Use the open to work badge.   When you are are at 500 connections, start trying to connect with recruiters and with managers that are in your state.   Actually meet with the people at the temp agency.  Talk to them and listen to what they say.  Talk to your placement office at your school.  Typically your state and local government has job assistance programs.   Finally, consider the military.  You can get training for a career through them with verifiable experience.   But if that is the reason, then stay away from the marines.

Job hunting can be brutal, but don\\u2019t sell yourself short. I\\u2019m sure your history degree has given you some seriously valuable skills. You must know how to research, analyze complex information in a context, and communicate clearly. That\\u2019s huge. A ton of jobs (product management, marketing, consulting, UX research) need people who can break down information and make sense of it. I was a product director in a major European HR tech startup and I looked for these skills when I hired PMs. The trick is translating what you learned into what employers understand. It\\u2019s not you, it\\u2019s the game. They may not want to listen \\u201cI studied history,\\u201d but something like \\u201cI analyze trends, find insights from data (even if it\\u2019s historical data), and communicate findings effectively.\\u201d That sounds way more like someone they\\u2019d hire. I don\\u2019t know which jobs you applied to or how the US job market is (I\\u2019m Spanish), but there are many fields where those skills matter. And if you have the energy, picking up a bit of data analysis or SEO could make you more marketable fast. I know it sucks right now, but you have real skills. Hang in there.\\n| tinastep2000 (1 upvotes): I was able to get an internship at a tiny non profit then got a receptionist job at a small firm, I\\u2019d say that\\u2019s where I started my career.

It\\u2019s about trying to stand out against the sea of applicants unfortunately\\n| oftcenter (1 upvotes): Check this out, OP. Your lack of internships hurt you the most. And your major might have too, depending on which jobs you\'re pursuing. Yes, internships can be as competitive to get as jobs. The people who say \\"You should have done an internship\\" conveniently ignore that fact. No, most companies don\'t count your years in school as formal experience. Yes, that is a problem. You should freelance if you can. If you can\'t freelance, you should volunteer. If you can\'t find volunteer positions that don\'t require experience, make your own volunteer position. Cold call small organizations and offer to volunteer skills you already have. Or contact departments at your college and ask if they need volunteers or know someone who does. But whatever you do, make sure your volunteer work will enhance your resume.  As a volunteer, you get to be more picky about what you will and won\'t do than you would as an employee. If you find that you\'re stuck doing menial tasks that don\'t enhance your value to employers, just leave. If you don\'t have skills to volunteer with, think of a personal project you want to do and learn the skills it takes to complete it. Keep the project small in scope so you don\'t get overwhelmed. When you\'re finished, lather, rinse, and repeat with a few more projects. Then put those projects into a portfolio, and link to the portfolio on your resume. Describe those projects on your resume too. Yes, this is a lot of work above and beyond the four years you just spent studying. No, you shouldn\'t have to do this after spending four years studying and being involved in campus organizations. Yes, someone should have told you years ago this would happen. Yes, this is a pile of horseshit.\\n| Pickachuwrangler (1 upvotes): My only advice is be relentless and FOLLOW UP! I\\u2019ve only been out of a job for 2 weeks at a time at most and most recently only took like 70 applications to find a job i enjoy for now. Follow up is huge, and you can\\u2019t let the market win. Sign up for delivery like door dash or amazon. Apply places you don\\u2019t really want to work but the pay will work. Just keep manifesting until it happens\\n| MostSeriousCookie (1 upvotes): All of the platforms you mentioned are geared up towards ppl who got higher education in fields that are on those platforms (history is not one of those...)  or have meaningful hands on experience.  It would help to know what positions you are applying for, however, let\'s just say that at the moment there is a very high competition for people who have much better credentials than you do so it is not surprising that you are not even getting replies. P.s. on top of all of that, market is flooded with bots applying to everything they can, so recruiters are overloaded with nonsense and simply do not have e the luxury of getting to every applicant in a low key position since the demand is that high...\\n| Dogmama1230 (1 upvotes): Don\\u2019t give up hope, friend.

Decades of uncertainty, recession fears, nepotism hiring, inflation, and just stuff outside of the average person\\u2019s control has ruined the job market in every way possible.  Unless you have a family member or close friend in a high up position willing to hire you, your chance for a job that will pay to put a roof over one\\u2019s head and provide a livable wage is awful.  In other words, we are in a system designed for us all to fail.  And, until something changes, the American dream is over.

Should add things like data entry, excel, budget management.   What roles are you applying for in particular?   My recommendation is to go into a vocational training.

This is personal experience within the corporate world for 40 years. If you are wanting a corporate job, they prefer to hire locals. WHAT CORPORATIONS THINK ABOUT LOCALS: They are steady. They have family in the area. They are connected to the community in some way. They are comfortable in their life. They aren\\u2019t app to leave the area. Use some of those thoughts on your resume. It does make a difference. Resume: willing to relocate: employer - they will be gone soon if I hire them. No. Resume: I grew up in (HERE -fill in the blank): employer - all the reasons I\\u2019ve listed above about locals. You have an aunt or cousin in a particular city: \\u201cMy family lives here (fill in the blank)\\u201d.  You have to give them a personal connection.  Sometimes a printed resume presented to a local business (corporation) is more effective than all the online \\u201cconnections\\u201d. I know, some places only accept online resumes, but then there are exceptions. You are not worthless to someone out there unless you are truly worthless to everyone. There are millions and millions working so someone saw their worth at some time in their lives.\\n| kingLarry456 (1 upvotes): If you need a shoulder to cry on, I\'m sitting in my room right here.\\n| switchwith_me (1 upvotes): Been there.

It\\u2019s absolutely a fake thing HR people created to make their life easier. They simply are bad at doing their job so they wanna streamline the process by adding this new \\u201cnetworking\\u201d feature. If this generation starts to give in on this trend the future generations will blame us for making this a thing. If not for our sake do it for the future generations by not making this a thing. Networking/cold emailing to recruiters is nothing but just boosting their ego.

Make a video and send it directly to both HR and the hiring manager for the job you are applying for. Make a different video for each job you specifically want. Working smarter instead of harder may help you! (2) Take the classes necessary to teach high school and start applying at school districts. Lots of teaching jobs come available. While you are applying do substitute teaching at the schools you are most interested in. The teachers and office staff will get to know you. This will give you an \\u201cin\\u201d with the schools if they think you\\u2019ve been a good substitute. (3) Go to college again for a degree that\\u2019s in high demand like nursing or accounting. Or go to some type of trade school like for airplane or car mechanic, electrical or HVAC training.., something like that\\u2026\\n| GeoHog713 (-12 downvotes): SO you\'ve sent 350 applications online Applying online is the least effective way to get a job.

And because employers have all the power, they\\u2019re being picky to a sadistic level, putting candidates through round after round of interviews, skill tests, and personality assessments.  The average time from application to offer is now 43 business days, or approximately two months. 20 years ago, it was two weeks. 50 years ago, a week. When our grandparents/great grandparents were our age, they could walk into a building at 9am and walk out with a job offer before noon. Hell, my grandfather started his job the day he applied\\u2026and worked there for 45 years until he retired. One friend of mine got put through 28 rounds of interviews, 6 skill tests, and 4 personality assessments over a period of 5 months, only to get an offer than was 40% below market.  By contrast, a kid at the last company I worked for was the CIO\\u2019s nephew. He went from application to offer in less than 72 hours for a mid-senior position he was nowhere near qualified for, was exempted from all skill tests\\u2026and his offer was 40% *above* market, no less. Nowadays, you either have to be a c-suiter\\u2019s kid or be an influencer with a million followers to even get an interview.

Good luck to you Wednesday!\\n| | | enlightened_sun (1 upvotes): Thank you, praying for you as well cause we both need jobs.\\n| WorkWorkWorkLife (4 upvotes): I get tired mentally and physically after applying to 3 jobs. And its not even the easy apply ones, its like where they ask you an average of 5 questions on list your education and work experience that applies to the position, and they expect you to write in paragraphs. I do have a phone interview invitation for next week, but I do feel like I need another week to reset, but whatever goes, this is the job market now.\\n| | enlightened_sun (3 upvotes): I hate the ones where you submit your resume and STILL have to type out all your work history/dates, and address I think it\'s the workday ones..\\n| | | WorkWorkWorkLife (1 upvotes): I don\'t live in the States but just above the States. Definitely encountered those whenever I apply for city jobs. I think that\'s the results of HR trying to make their lives easier instead of job seekers. I do agree with you on how stupid it is when you\'ve already uploaded your resume and still have to type out the same information just because they couldn\'t find a way to have a system that automatically fill out the spaces instead of having to retype or copy and paste everything.\\n| a_lovelylight (1 upvotes): The emotional and mental strain does actually take a physical toll. It\'s all so damned exhausting.  The way I handle it is to do four 30-minute sessions a day six times a week. Sometimes there\'s not enough to fill those sessions, sometimes there is. I\'ve found no correlation between being one of the first to apply versus one of the last. When you have the ATS winnowing things out, then HR winnowing even more, it doesn\'t matter as much. Could be industry-specific, though.\\n| Supersix4 (1 upvotes): It seems pointless. Fighting tooth and nail for roles that by the time I could be successful I\'ll be close to burned out and still run all the risks associated with a new job. Staying put is even worse as there\'s a reason(s) I want to go...\\n| DifficultyNew6588 (1 upvotes): I feel like I die a little on the inside when I have to fill out applications that allow you to upload your resume yet still require you to manually input all of the same data.  Especially when halfway through it, the program glitches out and mismatches all of the data and you have to start over again.\\n| RiseonCareer (0 upvotes): Use multi ai agents to help ypu automate flowz.. empower ypur career with ai - RiseON Suite\\n| | cupholdery (1 upvotes): >Use multi ai agents to help ypu automate flowz.. empower ypur career with ai - RiseON Suite [You\'re](https://www.reddit.com/u/RiseonCareer/s/wmXR8TYzBk) part of the problem.

I\\u2019ve scored tons of interviews and the ones that decided to move forward were of course the lower paying ones (I\\u2019d be taking a 40k pay cut). So I\\u2019ve waited a bit longer and of course the jobs I wanted have led me on and made it seem as if they wanted to hire me, EVEN asked me to complete tasks for the company, just to become unresponsive and close the job online? Now I\\u2019m left here with multiple completed projects for what? What am I supposed to do? I\\u2019ve reached out twice, should I say something on Monday? That was my potential start date. On top of that, they posted an additional position that I\\u2019m extremely qualified for, should I apply to that one? I just need a sense of clarity.

It\\u2019s entry level and have to work my way up again. I had to start sending cover letters, making follow up calls, etc in order to catch people\\u2019s attention.

The unfortunately reality is that you are unemployed so while you should get paid fairly based on the job they have to offer (and most company do so that), your current pay is zero.\\n| | LikeATamagotchi (7 upvotes): My friends soon to be ex husband was making 230k. He got fired and had to do unemployment. He searched everywhere for a job that paid 230+. After awhile of nothing, he finally took a job for 160k. He was pissed about taking a 70k pay cut but my friend told him \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a 70k pay cut, it\\u2019s more than unemployment and that\\u2019s what matters.\\u201d So yea, he can see it as a 40k pay cut but in reality it\\u2019s better than nothing. I am currently looking for another job and I know for a fact for my lifestyle right now, I can\\u2019t take less than 85k. I see so many jobs I\\u2019d be perfect for and they are in the 60k range and I wouldn\\u2019t be able to afford daycare if I took it. \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f\\n| AccidentPleasant4196 (29 upvotes): Sometimes we find ourselves in the position of taking the job we need not the job we want. I encourage you to not give up and accept what you can get for the time being.

I\'ve hired about 10 people and it seems like the ones that were currently employed stood out above the ones that weren\'t currently employed.

Some money is better than no money\\n| | tooreal4u_5101 (1 upvotes): We have been doing that for years. Our bills and rent don\'t take a paycut when we have to take a paycut, so it\'s really not fair. Things have to change.\\n| Queue_Eh (22 upvotes): Over 1000 here.   I\'m right there with ya.

They don\\u2019t want to go through training you when that looms over their head. Just change your resume to make yourself seem less senior when you\\u2019re applying to roles that aren\\u2019t ideal. Problem solved.\\n| | | | OutoftheBox701 (0 upvotes): There is logic as to why they say that, because just as someone else said in this forum, \\u201cget a job now, but keep looking for a better one.\\u201d And THAT is why companies won\\u2019t hire overqualified people, because they know the instant an overqualified person finds that better job, they\\u2019re gone, and the company has to go looking again\\u2026 so why bother with that potential headache.  Sure it\\u2019s frustrating for the unemployed, but it\\u2019s pretty illogical to expect a company to take on risk just for that unemployed person. It\\u2019s just the reality of the situation. I\\u2019ve been there, my career is rather niche, so it\\u2019s excellent when I have a job that fits, but it\\u2019s hell when I have to job hunt. It took me 3 years to get a great job. You just need to have a plan B, and most people don\\u2019t.\\n| | | | | tooreal4u_5101 (1 upvotes): Wrong. It\'s illogical to be in this world, in this society, knowing that the majority of people dealing with high cost of living and raising inflation and rents like everyone else, and then try to dictate and assume what the future would look like if an \\"overqualified\\" worker gets on-boarding. Nobody gives a flying f*** what a company \\"thinks\\" is going through an \\"overqualified\\" candidate\'s mind. They DON\'T KNOW SH*T ABOUT F*CK. THERE IS NO LOGIC to telling someone \\"overqualified\\" that they will be bored, when that person could have been rejected or overpassed for all the \\"qualified\\" positions they would NOT be bored at.  They still have f*cking BILLS TO PAY in the meantime, right??? Why wouldn\'t you use your brains to realize that maybe the \\"overqualified\\" person had already been applying to hundreds of jobs they would NOT be bored at, to no avail???  So obviously a company SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING and give the overqualified candidate a chance if they truly WANT to be there and are humbling themselves. It\'s ILLOGICAL for a company to post positions needing candidates, just to PASS UP candidates who actually want the job.\\n| | | Harris0615 (8 upvotes): 4 degrees here and 2k jobs... yeah I feel that, please mcdonalds or Walmart, just hire me..\\n| | | | meLone13 (1 upvotes): All of a sudden, I don\\u2019t feel so bad. 3 degrees, 1k jobs \\ud83d\\ude02\\ud83d\\ude2d\\ud83d\\udd2b\\n| ParisHiltonIsDope (15 upvotes): I promise Im not trying to discount your struggles when I say this. But I\'m reading in between the lines of what you\'re saying here. The fact that you say you\'ve been on \\"tons of interviews\\" out of 300 applications already puts you leaps and bounds ahead of others. There\'s a lot of people in this subreddit that put out far more applications with absolutely zero response. So you can already count yourself successful in that front. And not only are you landing call back, you\'ve advanced deep into the process with some and have even received offers. And it sounds like you\'ve accomplished that multiple times? I think it\'s worth just zooming out really quick and taking a pragmatic approach to your situation. Obviously, your resume is working, your background skill sets are valuable. You are a wanted asset. At least attractive enough for employers to call you. So that part of your job search is fine.  If you look at all the failure points, what\'s the common denominator? It\'s you right? Just throwing this out there, what if it\'s the way that you interview. What if it\'s the way that you present yourself in person? Not trying to insult you or drag you down. But maybe there\'s room for improvement with how you present yourself during the actual interview process.  During these multiple interviews, have you worked on improving yourself so that you\'re better than you were the last one? Or do you step into the interview with the exact same process as you did before? Have you asked for advice from the recruiter on how to succeed with the hiring manager? Because there\'s something not working during the interview phase. Try doing some roleplay interviews with friends and family. Take All the interviews you can, even with the jobs you\'re absolutely not interested and accepting. Just for the sake of practicing the interview. After each interview, have a true 101 session with yourself to analyze what went right, and what went wrong and what you could have done to be better. You should be able to answer each three of those pillars. If you truly believe that you\'re doing nothing wrong, then that\'s what\'s wrong.\\n| | immortalgod6 (5 upvotes): Alright, I\\u2019ll definitely keep note of this.

It bothers me that I\'m hearing more and more people are getting roped in to do free work. This has to stop its akso free plagiarizing. But I hope you get hired.\\n| BrunoandBexxie (4 upvotes): Maybe consult with someone? I live in PA and we have something called Career Link where they help make sure your resume is good and help with interview skills. NOT saying you are lacking in any of that but things change so rapidly that a resume that once was on point, can now be hurting you simply because a lot of companies are using AI to scan over resumes and nix many of them before a human even sees them. Maybe you are unknowingly doing something that is coming off in a bad way or confusing the hiring person. Just make sure you\'ve covered all the bases. Honestly, places just low ball everyone too and they take the most desperate people or those who don\'t know their worth. It sucks but its true.\\n| | BeerluvaNYC (1 upvotes): TY.\\n| RocksAreOneNow (5 upvotes): sounds like the company just wanted free work.\\n| kynell3482 (3 upvotes): I would invoice them for the project.

Oh, my dear. Stop.  Only 20% of the open jobs are ever advertised in any way. Please get hold of What Color is your Parachute by the late Richard Bolles.

Don\\u2019t rely on some washed-up hiring manager to hire you.  Look. We live in a time where you can make money doing anything. There are people making weird noises in a f*cking microphone and earning six-figures +\\u2026  Let me pit things into perspective: we are in a depression right now (I don\\u2019t care what anyone says, we are). Applying for a job is like buying a lottery ticket. Most jobs are getting 300-500+ applicants. That means that your odds are 1 in 400~. Why gamble? You don\\u2019t need capitol to start a business. Do a service like me. I write essays for med students, create content, and edit photos. I\\u2019m willing to bet that you have a skill that you can freelance or create a business out of. STOP waiting and wasting away. Get out there and create a path for yourself. \\ud83d\\udda4\\n| Cutemama14 (1 upvotes): I would apply for the newly posted job, especially if it\\u2019s a great fit for your background. I had a scenario like this recently and I waited to hear back about the job I was already interviewing for (which was a so-so fit at a lower level) so I didn\\u2019t apply for the other one because I was afraid to mess it up.  When the recruiter called me to let me know they had decided to go with someone else for the position I was already going for, I asked him about the second position but it was already closed and he said it would have been fine to apply for a second role at the same company while still interviewing for the first.\\n| | immortalgod6 (1 upvotes): Thank you.

Because of your integrity and honesty and qualifications. So, refine in a list: 1. Job description 2. Job atmosphere 3. Co-Worker attitudes  4. Rate of pay / benefits / holidays etc 5. In an interview, the best fit won\\u2019t ask you to compromise by doing unpaid work. Look for those things and you will clearly identify your ideal work place. You can do this!!! Your level of care, integrity, honesty and patience have shown what a quality person you are.

Best thing that EVERY happened to me.  Went out on my own and started consulting.  Was a little slow at first, but quickly I was making bank.  I work half time and make $140-150K/year, what I made after 25 years in IT as a system architect and manager of 20 developers.  16 years later, I love my job.  I work a lot, but its for ME.  I typically work from home but can work anywhere I have WIFI, so it allows me a LOT of freedom.      I suggest that everyone should find something they are good at/and or love to do and make a business of it.  You can start part-time but grow it.  The sooner you do this, the sooner you can get out from under the thumb of others with whom you are at their mercy.  You\'ll never get rich working for \\"the man\\" and they will always have control of your life.\\n| ComfortableRoll1961 (1 upvotes): I totally understand your frustration. Please don\\u2019t give up take a job even if it\\u2019s beneath you. It\\u2019s easier to find a job when you have a job than it is when you\\u2019re unemployed. It\\u2019s better to have some income coming in while you\\u2019re seeking another position. Don\\u2019t give up\\n| Spiritual-Amount7178 (1 upvotes): Don\'t feel so down brah\\n| Fit_Tiger1444 (1 upvotes): I\\u2019m going to try not to sound like a \\u201ctough love\\u201d coach here.  First, if you\\u2019re getting offers that are $40K lower than you used to earn, take them. That assumes the income is more than unemployment of course. First reason - as others have said, looking for a job when employed is easier than when unemployed. Second, if you kick ass and add value, that $40K deficit will reduce quickly. I\\u2019m not just passing along some homily here - I personally have taken a $50K pay cut and a huge bonus potential cut to put food on the table. By following my own advice I\\u2019m better off than I was before I did so. And I\\u2019ve seen that pattern in multiple colleagues\\u2019 and friends\\u2019 professional lives too. Focus on getting a job, adding value, performing, and moving up\\u2026and if you do that while looking for a better job, that\\u2019s great! Second, network like crazy. Most \\u201cgood jobs\\u201d go to people who are known and have a track record, not to people who randomly apply. It\\u2019s who you know, not what your resume says.  Third, transform your mindset - you\\u2019re on a job HUNT, not a job search or a job forage. Not only should you tailor your CV and correspondence to the individual job, you should do it to the company. Research them online. Prepare. It\\u2019s all the better to present a business case for getting hired.\\n| Ok-Twist6045 (1 upvotes): Unfortunately \\"we\\" gave then the power to abuse us long ago.

I\'m a hiring manager but it\'s considered any additional duty, I still have to do my regular job that has completely different duties so reviewing resumes and setting up interviews with prepared tailored questions takes time not to mention explaining to each individual why they didn\'t get picked. A lot of times I do wanna hire someone who has a lot of experience but the requisition is written for a mid level experience which means less pay. I make an offer, but 100% of the time so far it\'s rejected (which seems to be reflected in what you\'re saying too). Or the customer I support decides to hire internally or move money around for a completely different job they need filled at the last second. Bottom line, even as I hiring manager I still don\'t have a lot of control of who gets hired or the time to explain why someone didn\'t get a position. The higher in experience will always narrow your opportunities unless you work your way up again from a lower position.  I got let go due to budget cuts from the military after 7 years was unemployed for about 6 months with a college degree, had tons of interviews with no luck and it sucked. I ended up going to work for best buy to pay the bills and that was around a $50k pay cut. It sucked and was embarrassing. But after a pain staking couple of years I finally got a well paying job. It shouldn\'t work the way it does.. But it does and you just gotta keep grinding it out, getting a shit paying job while looking for the better one.\\n| SafeDog6682 (1 upvotes): Same boat all 5 years o college for nothing..4 years of applying have to work at home depot or Walmart.

It\'s ironic to me when people say they\'re scared of Trump, but then move to countries that have cultures, laws, governments, etc, that are way worse than Trump. Japan, for example, is still governmentally and culturally fascist. I have a Japanese friend, Ph.D graduate, and full blooded Yamato.

It still isn\'t, and I haven\'t found anything since November. I can\'t even get a job at a grocery store OR pet store. I don\'t have any experience in anything other than factory/kitchen/pet care. This country blows massive chunks friend, but maybe look at Europe.

U.S corporations were exploiting the system with tax breaks , government contracts ect.. so they had money flowing in to support their losses but now that everyone is poor their sales are down so they are balancing it with layoffs. Smaller ones / startups used cheap loans and hype. You build a company with some shit idea , pull a ton of investor money and hire people to work on that... After years of constant losses  you go into the stock market , your company has x millions of investments in the bank + the loan and has a decent amount of employees. Right after the launch while the price is high , initial investors sell out with a decent profit rest wait until you make some real profit.   Well? After printing billions of dollars to save devalued dollar and to lower the inflation FED increased the interest rates. Investments shifted and loans became more expensive or harder to get. No new companies or projects means less people hired, more unemployment means less spending, less spending means less demand means lower prices.. that is the general idea , but this idea dismisses the fact that operational cost increases and other factors which may have contributed to higher prices. For example gas became much more expensive do to Russian-Ukrainian war. Biden didn\'t mention anything about the real unemployment numbers , Trump didn\'t even tried to use it as a narrative during the election, not a peep..   At some point we have to realize that policy is not determined by Trump or Biden, big money decides these policies. How else can you explain Trump\'s 180 on H1B cap ? He is supposedly putting all this show to pull companies to invest in the U.S but at the same time letting companies offshore jobs to other countries .. Right now , loans are high, economy is slowing down and may even shrink according to some sources. Big tech milked the \\" we are the best \\" narrative too much without actually delivering a return and now they are challenged by countries like China. Yet they are still making short term decisions to seem profitable, not investing in U.S employees or in their future. The ship is sinking, I really hope they do not intend to sink it. Anyways , it is a shit time, it is normal that you are not getting any call backs .. hang in there and hope for the best.\\n| | Red-Apple12 (2 upvotes): good breakdown. do you see any positive change on the horizon?\\n| | | who_oo (3 upvotes): All I know is it can not last forever... we are pretty close to the tipping point.

They\\u2019re not going to hire unless an absolute necessity -there\\u2019s too much risk, and the possibility of an economic fallout.

Pay is liveable in most areas, but you start work at 4am (sometimes earlier), work 10-12 hour days, your 2 days off per week are usually split up, and it is a somewhat physical job. Main requirements are no felonies, clean driving record/license/insurance, and high school diploma.

The positions would either be Route Sales Representative or Merchandiser. Now, I\'ve worked there as an RSR, and the way they conducted business made me leave.

Short-term I\'d say 2 years is too long to stay in a job, you\'ll never get promoted and you\'ll never get a raise. So might as well leave and promote yourself and get yourself a raise at another place. The downside is, as soon as you get a job, you must start looking for your next one. It\'s a mental task which is taxing and lends to instability. The other way is to employ yourself, hire yourself, follow your passion no matter whether it pays well or not.\\n| Legitimate_Ad785 (2 upvotes): Start something yourself. When I graduated college, I couldn\'t get a job as it was the worst recession ever. I did things on the side, sold things online, and did SEO for people I knew.

It\'s just HR people trying to justify their existence.\\n| cjroxs (2 upvotes): Most county offices have a employment center. Our offers resume reviews, mock interviews and job fairs. Also look into the local city governments. Public safety often times has many openings, from 911 operators to parking assistants to park rangers. Rec centers also often have hiring opportunities. Public schools have lots of non-teaching jobs. State parks might be hiring for the upcoming seasons. Youth camps are ramping up as well. Any industry that caters to summer tourists.

Sadly most STEM entry level jobs are being offshored. The schools are about 10 years behind in preparing students for the real world. Mainly because they all live outside of the real.working world and only have rose colored academy lenses.  Here is the real world. You got a generic degree. Its great and it shows future employers you can dedicate yourself and follow through with a major commitment. That\'s it. That\'s all it means. Now all you have is basically very limited experience in any job. So the reality is, you are going to be competing with high school grads, previous stay at home parents and others just starting out. These entry level opportunities are brutal and people tend to hire the cheapest.  You need to think outside the box and start thinking about these jobs as networking opportunities. Does this entry level job get me in the industry or offer positions I could apply to in the future as an internal applicant? You need to broaden your net and look at any job is a good job even if it isn\'t a full-time job or your ideal job.

Part time jobs are a little easier to get.\\n| oaklandsideshow (1 upvotes): If you have friends or family in other cities where jobs are available, apply in those areas. If you get an interview, stay with them. Explain your situation to them. If you get any of those jobs, work on moving to take it. Your support network will probably help you get on your feet.

What kind of jobs you\'re applying for, and what your applications look like is stage 1, bearing in mind that you have very little work experience. Your largest problem getting up to the same starting point as everyone else is going to be what your immigration status is - if you\'re simply an international student, without permanent work rights, that\'s going to place you behind everyone else who has the same education and lack of experience as you, but who can be employed without the paperwork or risk of leaving the country.\\n| | Alarming-Young1026 (1 upvotes): Thanks for the insight! I do have 3 years of STEM OPT extension, so I can work in the U.S. without sponsorship for that period. Does that improve my chances, or do companies still see it as a hiring barrier?\\n| | | professcorporate (1 upvotes): You might be able to argue as part of your application why that reduces the risk and work involved, but inherently, anyone whose legal status relies on programs (which might change), or filing specific paperwork (which might be done wrong or missed) or future sponsorship (which is a lot of work) is more undesirable than someone who can simply show a passport/birth certificate/permanent residency card, and breeze through the normal channels.\\n| Secret-Marzipan-8754 (1 upvotes): Not gonna lie, Wisconsin Milwaukee is not a top school. Coupled with a lack of in-state work experience (understandable since you are international), the odds are stacking against you. Business analytics is a very common field. There is just nothing to differentiate you from the pool of qualified applicants. If it was Wisconsin Madison, you would have had some fighting chances.\\n| PmpkinKing2 (1 upvotes): Very low experience + being an international applicant is working against you sadly. The market is absolutely brutal right now. I\'ve been unemployed a year now, and I have two degrees and 10 years of experience in a Fortune 25 company.\\u00a0 You need to add some meat to your resume. Above your technical skills, add a skills section for soft skills; being a teaching assistant would give you; conflict resolution, project management, technical writing, mentorship, problem solving. Just to name a few. Also, put dates for your projects, and make those dates during the gaps in your employment so it looks like you were doing something during those employment gaps. \\u00a0Lastly, be more specific in your bullet points. OK great you redesigned course content, but how? What did you use to redesign? Frame it more like \\"Derived insights from student attendance data to redesign course content in mathematics, successfully improving student engagement by 30%\\". Remember your reader needs to have their hand held to really understand the impact you made.\\u00a0\\n| qbit1010 (1 upvotes): To be honest, I think you have a good formatted resume, it\\u2019s formatted clean. I would just suggest putting education at the bottom before technical skills. You have the right idea with experience at the top. That\\u2019s the first thing managers will look at (most people have some education these days).  Also use the tech skills section at the bottom to list ANY technology you\\u2019ve used and know.  List it in a linear format, not bullet point. It helps I\\u2019ve found with the ATS system.  Aside from that\\u2026all you can do is gain more experience to put on there, it\\u2019s not always a resume problem. It\\u2019s tough the first 5 years.\\n| sludge_monster (0 upvotes): There is inconsistent spacing in dash marks and inconsistent dash marks.

I\\u2019ve been studying frontend for 2 years now, applying to jobs in different countries, but so far, my record is 0 interview invitations. I\\u2019ve updated my resume multiple times, tried different application strategies, and even reached out to HR directly\\u2014still nothing. I\\u2019ve done a lot of freelance work, contributed to volunteer projects, and built real-world applications, but I still can\\u2019t land a job at a company. Am I doing something wrong? Or is frontend just that competitive right now?  If anyone has been through this, I\\u2019d really appreciate any advice! My resume is attached. \\n\\n52 Comments:\\n--------\\n| RedMarky (25 upvotes): Hey there, I work as an engineer on the frontend side in the US, so I will try my best to give some feedback but it will mostly pertain to the pattern we use here in The States, I am not too sure if the format is different for EU. 1) The resume looks clean and easy to read, but it may not be the best from ATS standpoint. There are certain resume formats that work better and increase your chances of getting into a recruiter\'s hand. 2) I would add dates for projects, education etc. 3) While the projects sound nice, try using the STAR (situation, task, action, result) method in bullets to describe the role and work. 4) Instead of adding just \\"LinkedIn\\" as a hyperlink at the top, I would add the full link because ATS and many scanning systems work better that way. 5) I would try to format the tech stack and skills in a way that you can split them in sub-categories like Web dev, databases, design, etc. and add the tools and technologies you know under there.  6) Not sure if Passions and Languages are a part of EU resume structure, but in the US I don\'t usually see it in most resumes. If you can, I would add a simpler resume structure and increase projects. Again these are just a few subjective tips, let me know if you have any questions!\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (2 upvotes): Thank you so much! I will research and apply your tips when I\\u2019m at home!\\n| | | treetop_triceratop (1 upvotes): I know completely changing your resume layout and whatnot can be daunting and overwhelming, so I just wanted to say that maybe you could try uploading your resume into Chat GPT (the free version should work fine for this) and tell it to create a new resume for you with a different layout that is better optimized for ATS systems, etc.  I\'d probably ask it to generate a couple of different  options/variations and see what happens. Then based on what it gives you, you could tell it which parts you liked and continue asking it to create more, basically having it re-do and refine things however you want it to. I personally haven\'t actually tried it for changing around a layout but it\'s been incredibly useful for rewriting my resume and retailoring it to a specific job, etc. Figured it\'s maybe worth trying if you hadn\'t considered it yet.\\n| xx4xx (37 upvotes): I hate that style of formatting (tbh)....and I hear most recruiters/HR do as well\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (6 upvotes): Is it the structure of the text, or something else?\\n| | | WatercressTop2942 (20 upvotes): This format is difficult for ATS programs to parse. All writing should be in unbroken left to right.\\n| Visible_Geologist477 (9 upvotes): You don\\u2019t need the \\u201cabout me\\u201d or \\u201cpassions\\u201d sections. I\\u2019m guessing you\\u2019re not in the US, but if you were then you need a degree for most roles.  The world is pulling away from foreign labor sponsorships - it\\u2019s a global thing. If you need sponsorship, expect to work 10x harder to find a job.\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (4 upvotes): Thanks for your feedback.  Yes, you\\u2019re right, I am in the EU. And regarding education, for some reasons, I didn\\u2019t get into university, I don\\u2019t even have a bachelor\\u2019s degree. Essentially, I\\u2019m a self-taught, so I tried to compensate for it with courses (to have something in the education section)\\n| | | BlakkHitman (2 upvotes): Recruiter here, there\\u2019s been lots of good points made so far, but the biggest for me is the amount of info you have in your last job (and looks like only job that was in a production environment). You have 3 bullet points for a job that lasted maybe 13 months or 30 months (if you had dates we\\u2019d know, so unless your hiding a short stint, add months); but yeah you have 3 bullet points of responsibilities that takes up maybe 1/12 of the page? The only thing an employers will look at is your last job if it\\u2019s your only one, elaborate!!.. Your passions, about you, soft skills\\u2026 they\\u2019ll learn that in an interview. You should Really talk about what you did, with what technologies, why you did it, and how it added value to your company. You should be able to get x2 or 3x as much info there. Projects are cool but still don\\u2019t matter as much as your real job, so they shouldn\\u2019t take up as much space. I\\u2019m ranting but ya, restructure the columns to save space too. Hope this helps, reply if you have Qs and I\\u2019ll add context.\\n| NuvaS1 (14 upvotes): No university degree stands out. No dates on projects or education. No location anywhere on CV Passions? remove that section why is css mentioned twice in hard skills? Only tailwind applies Remove html if you are to be taken seriously, it\'s not a skill to be able to open and close brackets :p it\'s on par as saying you know how to use excel. Make your experience follow xyz, same with projects. \\"Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].\\" Reformat the CV so it\'s sequential, it will be more readable. Make the about us standout. You say you write clean code, point them to your GitHub to prove it. Do not add links, but URLs. GitHub.com/someone.\\n| | NuvaS1 (1 upvotes): same with all the links you have. ATS might remove URLs make it easier to see\\n| | Dragonfly-Adventurer (1 upvotes): I disagree about Passions, I include a Personal Interests section and that sometimes leads to smalltalk with the hiring managers and panel interviewers. It humanizes you a little bit. Although this one is a bit boring. Everything else yes, the format especially.\\n| | | NuvaS1 (2 upvotes): sure doesn\'t hurt, I do it during \'tell me about yourself\' question lol His issue is zero interviews so I was focusing on, CV needs revamping and rewriting\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (-3 downvotes): Thank you for your time and feedback! I\\u2019ll apply your advice. I\\u2019ve blurred my location, and just as a note, my focus is on EU countries\\u2014specifically Germany\\u2014since I assume the application norms differ between the US and the EU.\\n| | | NuvaS1 (6 upvotes): That\'s not what I meant. You did a course (bootcamp), what\'s the location? when was it? You have experience, again what\'s the location and when was it, add months if possible unless u are trying to hide a gap  Also I know we are in a digital age but you never know if they can see or click URLs from inside the software. So always write Linkedin as linkedin/Daniel same with GitHub. If the projects you did are on GitHub, write \'see it on my github\' recruiters spend 7 seconds on a resume, if he reached that far and was interested, he will look you up and check it, otherwise it will not hurt you.\\n| | | | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thank you. I understand correctly now. All my education and work experience have been remote, but based on your recommendation, I should list it as \\u2018Remote\\u2019 anyway.\\n| AnotherAverageNobody (3 upvotes): I would cut out the soft skills because they\'re meaningless. It looks like you googled \\"nice adjectives\\" and just stuck them in. If you want to keep some soft skills stuff, elaborate more and give specifics from your project experience. You will need to move it out from the left in order to have the space to give those details. Same with the passions, I would cut that out as it is now. That\'s R1 icebreaker stuff you won\'t spend more than 30 seconds on in a real interview. It has no place being on your CV if you want to be taken seriously. If you really want to keep it, make them about frontend tech and explain more. You call them your passions but don\'t list anything about the career you want to spend every day doing?\\n| CountExact866 (2 upvotes): Try to use Harvard format Is better\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thank you. I\\u2019ll try that.\\n| Filledwithrage24 (2 upvotes): It\\u2019s poor formatting for online applications because the AI can\\u2019t read it as well as a standard format - I\\u2019m surprised you don\\u2019t know that given your background. You need to do a standard, linear resume format and fine tune it for each individual job app.\\n| slumbersonica (1 upvotes): I would move the dates for your work experience  next to the company rather than the section, but probably your portfolio isn\'t competitive. I suspect no one is hiring a frontend based off resume content when they can easily determine from the portfolio whether you have the level of skill they want. But you also might want to run it past a free ATS tracker online to see if it\'s passing.\\n| VerySuperstitious13 (1 upvotes): Look for the Harvard template. It\\u2019s accurate, easy and supposedly great for ATS trackers.\\n| Sea-Practice-7530 (1 upvotes): I cringe when I see the word \\u201ccomplex\\u201c. \\u201ccomplex\\u201d is relative, and quite frankly when I read resumes with that word, I jump to the conclusion that the author is a novice. Articulate what was complex about it.\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Makes sense. I will fix that, thanks\\n| dave_praxis (1 upvotes): Embedded tables on resumes can cause problems with Applicant Tracking Systems and cause automatic rejections. https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-tables-columns-ats\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thank you. I\\u2019m checking this rn.\\n| minerlj (1 upvotes): 1. Optimize it for ATS readers by making it 1 column instead of 2 columns 2. Replace \'about me\' with a professional summary. Be sure to include a sentence about why you want to work at the specific company you are applying to, tying that desire back in to your experience or skills. 3. Don\'t just say you worked on X project. Reducing load times by 30% may mean nothing to the person reading the resume so you may have to put that into stronger terms. \\"reduced load times by 30%, ensuring customers did not get annoyed and leave the website, increasing conversion rate and overall sales for the company by 5%\\" 4. you have a lot of skills but simply listing words like \'time management\' with no context won\'t mean much to a recruiter. It might be better to put that in your experience section as a bullet point. \\"Managed both projects simultaneously, prioritizing development tasks with effective time management\\"\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thanks! Such a good list of tips. I\'ll apply it.\\n| vxllvnuxvx (1 upvotes): remove soft skills, languages and passion, just talk about it when they finally interview you\\n| Bottlecrate (1 upvotes): Job search has all come down to what works best with ATS\\u2019s. I think your resume structurally is fine but as folks have said, ATS will probably filter this out. Recommend going on ChatGPT, and reformatting based on ATS best practices.\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thanks!\\n| criticalmonsterparty (1 upvotes): No one looking to hire you cares about your passions. They only if you can do the job they need or not.\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): I\\u2019m applying your advice in the new version. Thanks.\\n| HaveYouMetThisDude (1 upvotes): If you\'re a front end developer maybe you should make a portfolio website where you can show your skills.

Good luck!\\n| Ok_Honeydew9563 (1 upvotes): Idk what advice I can give you but what about can YOU give ME some advice? How can I find a free resume template/builder? I have no idea how and I need it as a png or smthn\\n| 1984kingsoloist (1 upvotes): Get rid of passion. Language section may be optional. expand your resume to at least two pages to give yourself more real estate. combine your work experience and projects together in order to highlight your achievement in qunatifible terms.\\n| Ok_Expression2974 (1 upvotes): You need to work on your German language skills\\n| SaaSFounder01 (1 upvotes): What is your average jobfit score when you apply?\\n| Tonguepunchingbutts (1 upvotes): Your resume is bad.

I think another problem is that I put absolutely everything I know/worked with.\\n| Agile-Creme5817 (1 upvotes): First glance: Your resume could be ATS incompatible with all these lines.  Quick recs: \\\\- Google \\"ATS friendly resume templates\\" and use one going forward. Simpler is better. You\'re a developer so you don\'t have to worry about complex designs or headshots (like actors, modeling, etc.). \\\\- Real estate space on a resume is vital in terms of design and copy. There\'s a lot of white space not being utilized and the formatted boxes make that worse. \\\\- Remove passions section and lead with achievements under experience. Something like \\"Seamlessly integrated code between 3 different complex platforms.\\"  \\\\- About me should focus on what you bring specifically to the role you\'re applying for, using keywords from the JD to trigger the ATS. No more than 3 - 4 lines.  \\\\- Chatgpt can help you create strong about me statements; just don\'t copy/paste because some businesses are uptight about it, will scan for it. Whatever it churns out, rewrite it in your resume and tweak it a little.\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thank you! I will apply that. I\\u2019m working on new version rn.\\n| samewakefulinsomnia (1 upvotes): Your resume is pretty vague now, huge amount of water. At this stage I\'d suggest to look for referrals & friends, it\'s pretty complicated to get a job at this level without connections. Maybe check out [plump.ai](http://plump.ai) free plan, it\'ll make a better CV for you at least\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thanks. I\\u2019ll check it out.\\n| Scary_Ginger_7274 (1 upvotes): The left column is meaningless. Absolutely useless without context. Needs more specific accomplishments - what did you actually deliver? What was the impact? Did you ship early/under budget? Don\\u2019t worry about the ATS there\\u2019s like a million of them. Clean and simple with lots of accomplishments is what you want.\\n| | daniel-coffee-lover (1 upvotes): Thanks, appreciate it\\n| Eng-Life (0 upvotes): Use AI to format and trim down to a front and back page with simple format style\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1jbuqlu'}]

I got messaged by a recruiter last week asking if I would be interested in a phone screen for an \\u201curgent job opening\\u201d (which already was a red flag) for a senior engineering manager. And he actually used the phrase, \\u201cwe\\u2019re looking for a unicorn here, the 1% of engineers here.\\u201d I humored him & took the call, until I found out the salary they were offering was not only middle of the road, it was actually below market value. For an average position, it was underpaid, let alone for the \\u201cunicorn\\u201d they were looking for. I just straight up told him, \\u201cThat is an insultingly low salary for this job description, and you\\u2019re going to get exactly what you\\u2019re paying for.\\u201d The recruiter got all flustered and tried to back pedal, saying all this about \\u201cthe current job market for this position\\u201d and \\u201ceconomic uncertainty\\u201d and stuff about other compensation such as equity and bonus. At that point I was over it, and had to tell him, you\\u2019re $60k below what that position should be paying. Thanks for the time, but I\\u2019m not interested. This was 3 weeks ago, and on LinkedIn, this \\u201curgent job opening\\u201d is still open lol, with the same salary band they were offering before. Once again, don\\u2019t ask for a \\u201cunicorn\\u201d if you\\u2019re not willing to pay for one.  Just goes to show how out-of-touch recruiters, especially foreign ones, are with the current job market.\\n\\n107 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A literal 10x software developer. Does the work of 5 others while finishing on thursday afternoon. They\'re the kind of people you have dreams and nightmares about. Dreams, because their work is unrivaled. Nightmares, because that\'s what they are to work with. Just money doesn\'t placate them. You\'re not their boss. _They_ decide when to work, how long. Could be 20 hours. 30 if you\'re lucky. _\\"Hey I\'m bringing my cat to work tomorrow. It\'s Feline Appreciation Day. Fuck your allergies.\\"_ That\'s the kind of placation you\'ll need. The money? That\'s just a minimum requirement.\\n| | puskunk (61 upvotes): I aspire to be that guy.\\n| | | LeicaM6guy (21 upvotes): I\'d just be happy bringing my kitty to work with me.\\n| | | | puskunk (13 upvotes): Be the change you want to see in this world.\\n| | | bbusiello (10 upvotes): Most people do. I prefer to stay in my lane and continue to learn new things to better understand *other job roles* rather than take something away from someone else while overworking myself in the process. Like tf.\\n| | | Sure_Comfort_7031 (1 upvotes): If you\'re too critical to fire then you\'re too critical to promote. Don\'t become too critical that the company can\'t work without you in that specific role. Otherwise you\'ll never get out of that specific role within the company.\\n| | vortexofchaos (45 upvotes): Yeah, I\\u2019ve worked with this kind of diva, a couple of times. Sure, they could piss code in giant streams of dense, undocumented volumes, but it was buggy in the weirdest ways, unreadable when you had to figure it out, and impossible to fix. They were a cybersecurity nightmare because of those weird and exploitable bugs. These people were a huge \\ud83d\\udea9\\ud83d\\udea9\\ud83d\\udea9 when I managed projects, because they inevitably left us in a worse position when they jumped ship for a more lucrative offer.  Give me someone who writes solid, dependable, readable, reliable code any day. Even better if a good day for them is ripping out the garbage left the \\ud83e\\udd2c diva, replacing it with code the entire team can understand.\\n| | | pheonixblade9 (11 upvotes): *actual* \\"10x\\" developers build stuff that is maintainable and secure and extensible. but they\'re exceptionally rare.\\n| | | | vortexofchaos (12 upvotes): I *never* saw one of them in forty+ years of my career developing mission critical software at various places. Every one of the \\u201c10x\\u201d developers I saw brought into the group were there to piss code to get to short-term deadlines, regardless of the quality of the \\ud83d\\udca9 they created. In my last job, doing cybersecurity research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, part of my job was teaching secure software development \\u2014 something most software developers I know had no clue about. The \\u201c10x developer\\u201d code I had to deal with was completely broken in this regard. You don\\u2019t want crazy 10x when you\\u2019re fixing a rare bug in the paging software of the VAX/VMS operating system, because that\\u2019s betting your entire company on a few lines of new code from one developer. That\\u2019s where you want me. You don\\u2019t want sloppy 10x code when you\\u2019re securing some of the most classified data about where things are in orbit in a way that still allows NASA to move the ISS to avoid space junk. That\\u2019s where you want me. I am not a 10x developer, but my code has gone into places where it has to work correctly every time \\u2014 and it does.\\n| | | bbusiello (8 upvotes): Jack of all trades, master of none.\\n| | | | NoSprinkles4835 (17 upvotes): \\"Is oftentimes better than a master of one.\\" Why does everyone get this quote wrong?  Neither a generalist nor a specialist is better, it depends on the situation.\\n| | | | vortexofchaos (3 upvotes): No, I want a team of queens of a few things each, to cover the areas vital to the project, with coverage such that when I lose one, I still have people who know the code and why it works the way it does.\\n| | | | kirashi3 (3 upvotes): > Jack of all trades, master of none. I\'ll take a generalist over a post-secondary \\"expert\\" lacking real-world problem solving skills any day of the week. That\'s not to say those with degrees aren\'t good - they heckin\' can be.

(happened to me)\\n| | | | Beyond-The-Blackhole (4 upvotes): This. I applied to a job where the lowest I would be willing to go was 80k based on the description. During the interview they made it clear they were more looking for someone to completely transition their entire tech processes to automation, while also leading and training the team to the new automated system. I had originally applied to just be an experienced analyst. But it seemed like they were looking for a lead, manager, coder, IT tech, developer, engineer and analyst who could completely transform their entire companys tech processes. If I wanted that level of work and responsibility even if I could do all that,  I definitely wouldn\'t be asking for 80k\\n| | | | Adventurous_Tart9574 (1 upvotes): I think you\\u2019re missing a few zeroes about 6.\\n| | NotCis_TM (3 upvotes): increasing employee count can cause the company to face additional regulations (such as disability quota) and there might just not be enough space in the office for all the \\"extra\\" people\\n| | | CravingStilettos (6 upvotes): So\\u2026 you\\u2019re a corporate capitalist apologist eh?\\n| | | | NotCis_TM (1 upvotes): nope\\n| BunchAlternative6172 (44 upvotes): \\"Hit the ground running\\" always reminds me of Beavis and butthead do American. They open the trunk and butthead just says to run backwards and slaps him on the back to tumble like hell.\\n| QuitCallingNewsrooms (39 upvotes): I have an interview coming up this week and I fear I\\u2019m going to hear a similar low-ball salary range knowing the job description lays out work for the equivalent of 5 FTEs. What I\\u2019m not sure is if the role also includes people management.\\n| | Insila (16 upvotes): Well, as a lawyer I tend to at least somewhat respect to the law, which is in this case would be Murphy\'s law. So uhh, of course it will, and you\'ll probably also need to be the fall guy for a volcano that has been brewing for a few years ;)\\n| | | bbusiello (6 upvotes): Fun fact, I recently applied for a graphic design job at a law firm. That uh... online form was something else. And I had to leave a lot of it blank because it just wasn\'t relevant.\\n| a_lovelylight (34 upvotes): Only the major companies like Google ever want to pay for an actual unicorn. The big wigs with the big money and benefits kind of set the floor for unicorns, so recruiters, hiring managers, etc can go complain at them, lol. I think these people forget that unicorns are fairly rare and pretty special *and the unicorns know this*. Yeah, you might get lucky and find one with low self-esteem, or who\'s just looking for work that\'s easy for them to bang out, but now why should this mythical beast work for *your* shit company? Lol. They also forget that technically unicorns don\'t exist, just really pretty horses dressed up as unicorns, or goats with their horns trained to grow as one....\\n| | Red-Apple12 (12 upvotes): and if a unicorn thinks you and your company sucks they will shit all over you\\n| | bbusiello (13 upvotes): From what I know about Google, they have teams of people who do a singular role. Not a lot of unicorns there. Bigger companies pay for full blown teams but they are much more difficult to get those jobs. Smaller companies either can\'t or won\'t pay for a team of 3+ so they expect a singular person to fill all those roles.\\n| bbusiello (34 upvotes): It\'s just as bad in areas of UX and design. The amount of shit we\'re expected to do is beyond the pale. I shit you not... at least a dozen jobs since Dec in my area (north of Chicago) want someone to do UX/UI, graphic design, video editing, animation, web design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CAD (in conjunction with Adobe Suite), social media management, photography (not editing in PS... I mean straight up be the photographer), 3D design... And be able to lift 60lbs on the reg. **$15-$17 an hour.**\\n| | SierraStar7 (3 upvotes): \\ud83d\\ude33\\ud83d\\ude33\\ud83d\\ude33\\ud83d\\ude33\\n| | rebel_dean (3 upvotes): A lot of the job postings for UX Designers and Product Designers is straight up ridiculous.  Companies have no clue what UX Design is.  They want a: UX Designer, Marketing Designer, and Social Media Manager all wrapped into one.\\n| | Complete_Astronaut (3 upvotes): \\"**$15-$17 an hour.**\\" That is not possible. Don\'t they know this? I used to work on a film crew earning $85 an hour. Plus overtime. But, I got tired of working outdoors year-round in rain/snow. So, now I earn \\\\~$40 an hour selling f\'n LEGO pieces out of my house\\\\~! No way in hell would I leave my home for $15 - 17 an hour doing brainy creative artsy work in an office. That\'s crazy! F that!\\n| | FrostyHorse709 (2 upvotes): Most animation jobs are the combination of stuff that\'s usually divided into separate departments in a studio. They\'re also the combination of several majors at art colleges!\\n| tatortot1003 (22 upvotes): I just love ads with descriptions that cover 3 positions and 25 years of experience to do any one of them. And pay is for rookies. If I find the pay during first phone call,,, I usually recommend they find someone that just made bail as thy will be desperate enough to take the job.\\n| meandering_simpleton (19 upvotes): There was a job opening in my field for someone with the combination of 3 different specialties, management experience, and PhD level experience in R&D.  Im guessing there are probably less than 5000 people in the entire world with those qualifications (realistically probably less than 1000). They were offering around 50% of the market rate. That position was open for around 2 years, and I\'m guessing they finally just gave up.\\n| Crabtrad (13 upvotes): A true unicorn (or whatever the label of the week is) are expensive BUT if they are said true mythical creature even at a fat salary should be worth more to the company than they cost.  But both sides are rare on this one, true unicorns and companies willing to pay for them.\\n| DontCallMeTenzo (15 upvotes): I recently had a similar experience, a growing company (50 people and scaling fast) wanted someone to do prod support, devops, platform engineering and set up monitoring with 4+ years experience. I knocked every essential and optional criteria out the park, the recruiters sent them 10 people to interview and they hated all of them apparently except me who they offered the job to\\u2026 for \\u00a320k below what they advertised on the ad even\\u2026. I would have been taking a pay cut from my current role where I\\u2019m only doing one of those responsibilities at a time They argued that everyone else on the team was getting paid less than that\\u2026 then they\\u2019re being underpaid? Also like why would they not offer the full salary for someone who meets all their criteria?\\n| OverCorpAmerica (13 upvotes): Say this same thing whenever viewing postings. The list of skills and experience is a mile long and then you see 20-25 an hour and I laugh. \\u270c\\ud83c\\udffb\\n| Fun-End-2947 (11 upvotes): The reality is usually Unicorn job spec, donkey wages\\n| NeophyteBuilder (9 upvotes): It\\u2019s happening all over tech roles. And those who have been out of work for a while, will take roles with a big pay cut - even if they senior role for junior salary. But unicorns?  Yeah, they\\u2019re smoking crack. My fave currently is an engineer with 5 years AI and LLM based product to production. As a non-senior engineer\\u2026. Same rate as an engineer without LLM experience!!! Or a non- senior product manager to own the ai product strategy for a company\\u2026. Laughs and tears\\n| treaquin (10 upvotes): Unicorn means they used to have one person who couldn\\u2019t take it anymore and left, and now they want someone who is just as efficient in record time\\n| AuthenticTruther (12 upvotes): We want a unicorn for this team playing, family environment, where you wear many hats, and are a real go getter for .... $400/week!\\n| Samurai_Mac1 (8 upvotes): They always want someone who can \\"hit the ground running\\" while being paid an entry level salary.\\n| Pygmy_Nuthatch (6 upvotes): The job isn\'t real. They already have someone in mind and have to advertise a job due to a law or a corporate policy.  If you want to hire an H1B, you have to advertise a job for a certain amount of time (to ostensibly give an American a chance). They\'re looking for a unicorn because they don\'t want someone to exist that fills the requirements.\\n| | Complete_Astronaut (2 upvotes): That makes a lot of sense.\\n| Sensitive_Let6429 (12 upvotes): True! Companies I\'ve been interviewing at want an exemplary candidate but still want to be 2018 salaries. At the end, I don\'t care few Ks on salary as much as respect during the interview process. But now all the stupid no name companies wnat to conduct 7 rounds of interviews and be rude all the time and THEN have the guts to offer peanuts. Because I have the luxury to have a job, I say fuck you to all those companies all the time now.\\n| laughertes (6 upvotes): I\\u2019ve been seeing a lot of that too, and I\\u2019ve directly told recruiters that their client was doing them dirty by limiting them to that salary range for the location they were hiring at.  I know recruiters in other industries that directly tell their clients that they aren\\u2019t going to get good applicants with the salary and benefits listed, but they are forced to use that range until the client says otherwise.\\n| who_oo (6 upvotes): Downplay salaries because people are desperate due to shitty market then expect what exactly ? For them to except it and work 3 times as much and deliver results? These people are dumb or naive.    The level of stupidity of these people .. do they expect engineers who got into dept to get an education, who have mortgages and bills to just cave in and say \\" welp this is the new reality now\\" and accept it ? With high inflation and cost of living , shitty medical system , high taxes .. as if it is a choice..       They should offshore it like those big companies they strive to be... offshore everything until there is no one left in the country who can afford to buy their shitty product.\\n| dementeddigital2 (6 upvotes): Thankfully, a lot of skilled people are over this shit, and just won\'t accept the position.  The role will stay empty until the company decides to offer more.  This puts upward pressure on salaries.  Good work!\\n| itchylot (4 upvotes): I interviewed with an immigration startup where the recruiter said the CEO was looking for a unicorn who had experience taking a company from like $1M in revenue a year to $100M+. I was cracking up in my head and thinking there\\u2019s no way a person with that sort of skills would work in that industry for what they were trying to pay.\\n| Kinkajou4 (6 upvotes): Any recruiter dumb enough to put the word \\u201cunicorn\\u201d in the job posting without severe embarrassment these days is a true idiot.  Just ignore them before they start yapping about being \\u201ca family\\u201d with you like a creep.  Their role sucks most surely.\\n| CuttingEdgeRetro (5 upvotes): This is probably the fifth recession I\'ve worked through\\\\*.  And I can tell you that recruiters and/or employers always act like this in recessions.  They smell blood in the water and think they can get someone who is their dream combination of \\"good\\" and \\"desperate\\" for dirt pay. In spite of this approach being incredibly myopic, it happens a lot, as if none of them can see six months down the road when their awesome unicorn will leave for less insulting pay.  They\'ll be shocked, shocked I tell you.  After all, this is a great place to work. \\\\* Don\'t tell me it\'s not a recession.  I care about the job market, not GDP numbers.  And according to the job market, we\'ve been in a recession for nearly two years now, and appear to be coming out of it.\\n| XtremeD86 (5 upvotes): Almost every job I see now that starts at near minimum wage wants 5+ years experience, master\'s degree, speak multiple languages, able to do the job of 3+ people and expected to work ridiculous shifts. Any job posting I see like this I just skip over and don\'t bother.\\n| Derpimus_J (3 upvotes): They want a unicorn but only willing to pay for a donkey with a party hat.\\n| Junior_Lavishness_96 (4 upvotes): Different industry here but yeah, I\\u2019m running into similar takes. This and that company has openings, must be able to do this, must at least this much experience, must be willing to do this and go here and there. Blah blah blah but then pay pretty much entry level wages. Like I know I need a job but jeez man, I\\u2019m not stooping that low\\n| steveo242 (4 upvotes): They never understand that.  We want a Ferrari level performance for Altima pay.  That\'s why they don\'t advertise the pay ranges.  Imagine walking into a Ferrari dealer with $25k and being like, let me and my colleagues have 6 rounds of test drives before we offer you $25k...\\n| MrIrishSprings (3 upvotes): \\"economic uncertainty\\" i\'ve been hearing too in Ontario, Canada. Maybe both sides of the border with the Trump tariff thing. but the unicorn jobs piss me tf off. outrageous and completely unrealistic. At least when I call these recruiters 2/3 of them acknowledge its ridiculous but then \\"sadly this is what the company/client is demanding\\" SMH!\\n| DeLoreanAirlines (3 upvotes): It\\u2019s even worse. I saw a listing for Final Cut Pro editing for $15 an hour. That\\u2019s not a unicorn because they didn\\u2019t ask for an entire software suite but that\\u2019s garbage pay for video editing. It\\u2019s all trash anymore.\\n| | Complete_Astronaut (3 upvotes): Back in 2003, as a teenager, I was paid... $25 an hour for Final Cut Pro video editing. Scratch that. Now that I\'m thinking about it, I actually charged a client $60 an hour for Final Cut Pro video editing. And, I actually paid for a brand-new 12\\" Powerbook G4 with SuperDrive and made them DVD\'s of the finished project. I literally bought the entire $1,800 computer (and software) with one three-day gig (with student discount anyway).\\n| montybob (3 upvotes): I had an interview. I knew the pay wasn\\u2019t ideal but I was hoping they\\u2019d look at some suggestions I\\u2019d made in terms of work from home that would make it a viable proposition.  The offer came in and as expected it wasn\\u2019t what I wanted.  The same day I declined, a recruiter got in touch with a salary 3k higher. How i laughed.\\n| 1re_endacted1 (3 upvotes): Part of the unicorn magic is finding a candidate that happy to serve for slave wages. \\ud83e\\udd79 You know, the DINK who\\u2019s partner is the breadwinner and parents gave them their old home when they got married. They have a trust fund and blue collar labor is their PASSION.\\n| | Background_Wrap_4739 (2 upvotes): I grew up in a working-class family in rural America but went to an Ivy League school. The number of classmates who had $10,000,000+ trust funds was ridiculous. I remember one girl graduated, moved to Boston, bought an apartment, and has spent the last 15 years doing graduate work in art history.\\n| SnooPineapples521 (2 upvotes): It really makes me wanna put them in a body cast\\n| Radiant-Gate-2353 (2 upvotes): It\\u2019s supply/demand law. That\\u2019s it.\\n| yodamastertampa (2 upvotes): Agreed. I\'m being recruited by a past employer for my specific mix or knowledge and skills for a special role. Because of this I will demand a big pay increase. They know I have an edge over almost anyone else so they will likely pay for it. This doesn\'t happen often but when it does they pay well.\\n| newbie_trader99 (2 upvotes): They are hoping to get a desperate applicant who would accept such low salary. In the current market, anything is possible\\n| sl3eper_agent (4 upvotes): They\'re looking for unicorns because unicorns are a dime a dozen. And they\'re about to get even cheaper once the government gets done firing 2 million people.\\n| lovebus (1 upvotes): Part of being a unicorn is accepting substandard pay.\\n| gunslingor (1 upvotes): Scams.\\n| bob_loblaws_law_bomb (1 upvotes): I\'ve seen several roles asking for 5+ years experience of Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Mongo, Snowflake, Postgres, Maria and Cassandra; these people don\'t exist! I know 2.5, I\'ve worked with people who know 5-ish - if you want more than that I promise you they won\'t be experts, so how do you expect to fill this position?\\n| ChiefProblomengineer (1 upvotes): Employers think that reality needs to bend to budget.\\n| _Casey_ (1 upvotes): Spoiler: they won\'t.\\n| WesleyWiaz27 (1 upvotes): Simple rule: Pay for monkeys, get monkeys.\\n| renro (1 upvotes): In most of America it is illegal to pay for these kinds of services\\n| nikonino (1 upvotes): Always ask for the budget of the position upfront. Most recruiters act like salesmen\\u2014they want to get you on the phone/meeting so they can justify their own salary to their boss, while also hoping to find someone desperate enough or someone they can underpay while still benefiting from their skills.\\n| klinacz (1 upvotes): I interviewed once for a SENIOR EXPERT position and they wanted to pay 60k less than the market value, making it not a livable wage. And I was like WHAT.\\n| Dash83 (1 upvotes): I was contacted some months ago for a position in a well-funded startup in Europe. The position paid well (but nothing crazy). When they described the recruitment process I was a bit baffled because it was insanely long. I commented on this and they told me it was like that because they were looking to hire the very best of the market, just as many FAANGs do. I pointed out their compensation did not match that. Pass!\\n| fuckyourcanoes (1 upvotes): Absolutely true. My husband\'s company has his absolute loyalty because they pay him what he\'s worth. He spent the first 18 years of his career shockingly underpaid. When he was offered his current job, they more than doubled his salary because he was so uniquely qualified. He\'s gotten a couple of nice raises since then. He\'ll do anything for this company, and he\'ll never look elsewhere.\\n| Logical-Ask7299 (1 upvotes): Translation: none of us have any idea what we are doing and do not possess the technical skills required to be in this field, so we are trying to find a superhero unicorn willing to accept garbage pay, to carry the company, so that someday a bigger company might buy it and we\\u2019ll all retire.\\n| oftcenter (1 upvotes): I know this is irrelevant, but God it hurts me in my soul to hear people even discussing the idea of a salary so large that $60k can be subtracted away and there\'s still enough left to put together an offer. Even if that offer is low by industry standards. I would have killed to make $60k.\\n| SnapPunch (0 upvotes): I would be kinder to the recruiter. They aren\'t the ones setting the salary, they are just the grunt selling the position. In general I agree with you on the lingo and that\'s why its best to ask about the salary range off the bat so \\"we don\'t waste anyone\'s time.\\"\\n| obelix_dogmatix (0 upvotes): You do know that it\\u2019s not the recruiter\\u2019s fault. They are nowhere in the pecking order that decides the budget for any position.\\n| Zerodyne_Sin (0 upvotes): Recruiters are class traitors.  They\'ve done nothing but undermine the labour movement ever since they became common.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1jc5kju'}, {'title': 'Red Flags: Unrealistic Recruiter Demands and Questionable Offers', 'text': '{"text":"Title: This job pays me in crypto I can\'t touch for 18 months\\u2026 legit, right?\\nAuthor: zFordex\\nUpvotes: 237\\nBody text: https://preview.redd.it/t3ofsi1fpvoe1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=607951cab8afa60551ba30a703fe76816c28110d    Imagine getting paid in monopoly money and being told it\\u2019s a \\u2018savings account\\u2019 \\ud83e\\udd21   Wanting free labor while they pump their coin is a next level of crazzzzzy\\n\\n31 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Probably calculating the 50% paid in ETH and if they can somehow live on that while searching for something better...\\n| Potential_Dentist_90 (11 upvotes): I never liked cryptocurrency because of how volatile it is. Quadriga CX collapsed when their CEO died suddenly, with no one else knowing the password to unlock customer money. They lost $190 million of customers\' various cryptocurrencies and immediately went bankrupt. They were the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada at the time of collapse. Meanwhile, money in a bank would be insured by the FDIC. If you have gold, or jewelry, or a first edition copy of Action Comics #1, and it is stuck in a safe, I can hire a locksmith to open it up. There is no option like this for cryptocurrency. One lost password or fire or hard drive failure and you\'re fucked.\\n| | Feligris (6 upvotes): Crypto is an excellent example of when strict regulation is successful in making something safe and smooth enough that a bunch of would-be entrepreneurs arrogantly think they can ditch large parts of it since \\"It\'s just in the way of innovation, and clearly nothing ever goes wrong anyway!\\", only to find out over and over again *why* the thicket of regulation and established best practices exist. Similarly, the [non-bank fintech bank Synapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse_Financial_Technologies) collapsed into bankruptcy a year ago, and in the aftermath a shortfall of tens millions of customer funds was revealed, but because Synapse itself wasn\'t legally a bank and it only kept customer money in FDIC-insured banks there was no help from FDIC even though Synapse and its fintech clients who had their own customers had touted FDIC insurance as one of the selling points.\\n| AzizamDilbar (11 upvotes): 100% legit.

I soon received almost weekly requests to (re-)apply.\\n| | wawaweewahwe (5 upvotes): Not being able to fill a role for over a year means they actually aren\'t trying to hire.
