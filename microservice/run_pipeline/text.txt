I was sitting and doing another resume revision and I just started crying. Spending hours wracking my brain trying to find the \\u201cimpact\\u201d I can add to my resume bullets at a job I did when I was TWENTY YEARS OLD.

I had a coffee shop never call me for an interview, and then sent me an email about how I missed my interview. I went down to talk to the manager about it, and he said he has no idea. I showed him the email and everything. This A.I. is trolling everyone.\\n| | | babbling_homunculus (5 upvotes): >you\\u2019ll need to have been president of a country to be a cashier.

Sad times ... /s\\n| | Istanbulexpat (2 upvotes): I\'ve definitely lost out on a couple positions due to low Twitter follower count. This is where we are.\\n| | | AuthenticTruther (1 upvotes): Big Oof. I\'m sorry, man.\\u00a0\\n| Visible-Mess-2375 (21 upvotes): That\\u2019s the modern American job market for ya. White collar jobs are going extinct thanks to AI and offshoring.  And because employers have all the power, they\\u2019re being picky to a sadistic level, putting candidates through round after round of interviews, skill tests, and personality assessments.  The average time from application to offer is now 43 business days, or approximately two months. 20 years ago, it was two weeks. 50 years ago, a week. When our grandparents/great grandparents were our age, they could walk into a building at 9am and walk out with a job offer before noon. Hell, my grandfather started his job the day he applied\\u2026and worked there for 45 years until he retired. One friend of mine got put through 28 rounds of interviews, 6 skill tests, and 4 personality assessments over a period of 5 months, only to get an offer than was 40% below market.  By contrast, a kid at the last company I worked for was the CIO\\u2019s nephew. He went from application to offer in less than 72 hours for a mid-senior position he was nowhere near qualified for, was exempted from all skill tests\\u2026and his offer was 40% *above* market, no less. Nowadays, you either have to be a c-suiter\\u2019s kid or be an influencer with a million followers to even get an interview. Otherwise, your choices are McDonald\\u2019s, Walmart, gas station, call center, or the military.\\n| | Jitterbug_0308 (11 upvotes): I was just screaming this at my friend the other day because I, too, remember walking into a place with a hiring sign and walking out with a job. Now that I have years of experience, printed right there in black and white, I\\u2019m having to jump through hoops just to apply to places I don\\u2019t even really want to work for.\\n| | | Visible-Mess-2375 (7 upvotes): My favorite are the positions that require 20 years of experience on platforms that have only been in existence for three. Or the ones that say \\u201cmust be high energy and dynamic\\u201d\\u2026.in other words, \\u201cthose over 40 need not apply.\\u201d\\n| | babbling_homunculus (2 upvotes): \\ud83d\\ude2d\\n| | | Visible-Mess-2375 (1 upvotes): That about sums up the state of the job market\\n| Traditional_Town5310 (14 upvotes): This was me few mins ago. It\\u2019s 5am where I live and I am so stressed that I couldn\\u2019t sleep so I started applying. Asking chatgpt to tweak my resume to fit the jd. making sure my resume is that ats complying shit! I go to sleep crying everyday.  Meanwhile some random person that didn\\u2019t even do their assignments in college are getting jobs somehow. I hate it when someone says don\\u2019t worry you\\u2019ll get a job soon and things will get better. and I hate saying this to the others who are in the same boat as well.\\n| | StudentOld6682 (5 upvotes): That\'s like what my mother says constantly. \\"Something will come up\\"\\n| FrostyHorse709 (21 upvotes): I\'m angry all the time\\n| joemama123458 (8 upvotes): Dude\\u2026 I can\\u2019t even get jobs with \\u201c3 applicants\\u201d lol\\n| Tasty-Bee8769 (5 upvotes): I\'ve been jobless since December, got ghosted so many times, did so many case studies and everything, and it was this week I got a job offer.

Fake drama just for money.\\n| Jitterbug_0308 (1 upvotes): I was a supervisor in a warehouse before I was laid off a year ago and each month I lowered my expectations for the jobs I was willing to do. I just got rejected by a maid service, so what\\u2019s next? As a female who is literally willing to dig ditches by hand for a living wage, it sucks to think that more people would pay to watch me play video games topless than for my work ethic.\\n| ella003 (1 upvotes): I\'m annoyed by people who say they have the answers but just repeat something they saw on LinkedIn.\\n| Cgdes242 (1 upvotes): I hear you all the way. It\'s stuff like this that makes me soo angry that I genuinely wished 90% of all business we know of (that post positions) suddenly went out of business, except for food, energy providers and auto service. Sucks to say this but it sucks that there\'s not enough people experiencing this to make it a common problem that most people can relate to. maybe a documentary on this hell were going through? I dunno.\\n| Training_Tour_2010 (1 upvotes): Join the military, honestly go officer, especially if you have your bachelor\\u2019s. It pays well and you could (possibly) bs your way through and get all the benefits you need and retire early.\\n| | matem001 (5 upvotes): I have asthma. But I guess I could do a non combat position? How competitive is it?\\n| | | Training_Tour_2010 (1 upvotes): Okay so for all positions they do test your physical fitness. But, it\\u2019s not competitive at all, the military is hurting for both enlisted and officer positions on all branches especially army. To go non-combat that would be a government contractor or federal job. But if you do make it past training I would say it\\u2019s smooth sailing from there. Officers usually start off with $50,000 ish base pay with monthly housing and food allowances depending on the state.\\n| | | | Visible-Mess-2375 (2 upvotes): This. And, you can retire with a pension after 20 years. Plus, when you *do* eventually reenter the civilian workforce, you\\u2019ll get preferential treatment from employers (especially for federal government jobs) and will likely get to bypass ATS and guarantee your resume will be seen by a human.\\n| Scrappy001 (0 upvotes): What skill set do you have?\\n| TubeInspector (-3 downvotes): JFC if you can\'t lie about one of your earliest jobs, you really don\'t deserve one now. Suck it up. Make ChatGPT do it for you if you can\'t be bothered.

I have a good friend whom works at a different company who told me about a job the company was thinking about creating that I\'d be perfect for (it matched my technical skills and experience). Upon his recommendation I went to one of their job fairs, introduced myself to the person spearheading the push for this job (based upon my friend\'s inside knowledge). 2 months later, after 3 interviews, I got my offer letter signed with a start date.

But your point does remain.\\n| HopeSubstantial (6 upvotes): If only it was that simple always. As summer is coming plenty of companies need summer workers to replace people when workers are on their summer holidays. I tried to apply for 3 different industrial places already in January before summer recruitment opened and the replies were: 1( Due confidental reasons we cannot talk about summer recruiting yet, please apply when it becomes public\\u00a0 2) We have not yet calculated worker recruitment for summer, please apply after the job posting becomes public\\u00a0 3) We will publish summer worker job postings later\\u00a0 For long term jobs I just get ghosted when I try introduce myself unless there is open job posting.

My friend applied to a job at this company a year ago and the owner of the company contacted my friend about a new job at the company but my friend referred me because he of course got another job at this point.

Okay got it. No but seriously I get it. You sometimes got to have a leg up on competition in this market. When companies are getting spammed with applications it is hard to stand out. You got a ton of people applying who are at least partially qualified, you got unqualified people applying to everything that exists, and you got applications from across the world spamming job applications.\\n| HaggisPope (1 upvotes): There\\u2019s a lot to this, my friend ended up making herself a job at a museum by highlighting a thing they didn\\u2019t have, offering to close the need, and it developed into a job.\\n| ThatsFatal (1 upvotes): Networking is the advice I\'m constantly given but when you don\'t have anyone to network with it isn\'t possible.

But despite meeting many job requirements, the biggest hurdle I keep running into is the \\"years of formal experience\\" checkbox. Recently, I found a cybersecurity role I really wanted, but LinkedIn\\u2019s screening questions made it clear I\\u2019d be auto-rejected. Instead of accepting that, I reached out directly to the job poster\\u2014who also happened to be the company\\u2019s CEO. I was upfront about my experience, but I also highlighted my certifications, practical skills, and transferable knowledge. My goal? To get my resume in front of the right person instead of being filtered out by automated systems or HR screening based on limited context. To my surprise, he responded positively! He reviewed my resume and told me to send it to a specific email address, mentioning that I was referred by him. It\\u2019s only been a few days, so I\\u2019m still waiting to hear back, but this experience has reinforced something important\\u2014job searching isn\\u2019t just about submitting applications; it\\u2019s about strategy. Sometimes, getting past gatekeepers means being proactive, reaching out, and making your case directly. Even if this opportunity doesn\\u2019t work out, I plan to follow up with him to see if there are other roles within the company that better match my skills. And if that CEO happens to read this post\\u2014just know that your response has boosted my morale and my resolve! If you\\u2019re in the job hunt, don\\u2019t be afraid to step outside the traditional process.

Company Page Search \\u2013 Go to the company\'s LinkedIn page, click on the \\"People\\" tab, and use keywords like \\"recruiter,\\" \\"talent acquisition,\\" or \\"hiring\\" in the search bar. 2. Job Post Details \\u2013 Sometimes, the job post itself will show who posted it. If you see \\"Meet the job poster,\\" click on it\\u2014that\\u2019s usually the person involved in hiring. 3. Google Search Trick \\u2013 You can use Google with a search like: \\ud83d\\udc49 *site:linkedin.com \\"Company Name\\" recruiter* Replac \\u201cCompany Name\\u201d with your target company in quotes, like ***site:linkedin.com \\"Old Mutual\\" recruiter***. This can help find profiles of recruiters or hiring managers at that company. Since you\'re new to LinkedIn, it might help to first focus on building your profile so that recruiters can also find *you*! Try searching on Google or YouTube for terms like *\\"how to use LinkedIn to find a job\\"* or \\"how to optimize a LinkedIn profile\\"\\u2014there are some great video tutorials that walk you through the process.\\n| | | Violet2393 (4 upvotes): Sometimes LinkedIn will show you who posted on the job listing. Some others things you can do are search the company and view posts associated with the company to see if the hiring manager has posted, you can also look at \\u201cPeople\\u201d from the company page and see if anyone had the purple hiring badge on their portrait then click into them to see if they have posted about hiring for your role.\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (5 upvotes): Congratulations! What approach did you use when reaching out?\\n| | Mithril_web3 (1 upvotes): Thanks for the tip\\n| lee_stash (6 upvotes): I did this once to try to put myself out there, the job poster read my message and rejected my application. I was 100% qualified for the job though, which made it that much worse. \\ud83d\\ude05\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (2 upvotes): Hahaha, what did you say in your message, \\"when do I start?\\" lol ?\\n| | | lee_stash (3 upvotes): Oh my gosh no lol I used chat gpt to help me formulate this very professional message cause I was so nervous (it was my first time doing this). So ..this experience surely didn\'t help \\ud83d\\ude02\\n| kevinkaburu (6 upvotes): Just did this recently and got a response from the CEO.  I was ghosted afterwards though.  Lol  Luckily I got a job at another company shortly thereafter.  I landed the job by reaching out to a recruiter on LinkedIn.  I tried not to circumvent the process on this one, but I was actually approached for the role by 2 recruiters, so I went with the one that sent me the invite first.  We were going back and forth, and I just so happened to respond to the other recruiter in my inbox to let them know about the situation, and they informed me that they were actually the one in charge of facilitating the interview process, so they were able to get me an interview much quicker.  If I had stayed with the first recruiter, I may not have gotten the job.  Circumventing can help if done strategically.\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (2 upvotes): Congratulations! I am glad that it all worked out in the end. Why do you think you were ghosted after the initial response?\\n| WinOk4525 (7 upvotes): Well done, but be careful getting your hopes up. In the past I\\u2019ve done this only to be rejected because of it. It\\u2019s someone\\u2019s job to make that job posting, it\\u2019s someone\\u2019s job to review the resumes that make it past AI filtering, it\\u2019s someone\\u2019s job to send your resume to a hiring manager, the hiring manager wrote the job requirements. You likely made someone look bad at their job because now the CEO is being forced to do their job. Also the person who is ultimately responsible for hiring you will now see you as someone who doesn\\u2019t follow the chain of command and will go behind their back to get what they want and make them look bad.\\n| | illiquidasshat (3 upvotes): Yep - I\\u2019ve tried this before going directly to the hiring manager after submitting my app, and sending a quick \\u201cHey I applied open to having a chat\\u201d message on LinkedIn, only to be told hey if were interested HR will reach out to you then promptly rejected.\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (1 upvotes): I get where you\\u2019re coming from, and I agree that it\\u2019s important to be mindful of company structures. At the same time, job searching often requires breaking out of rigid processes\\u2014especially when automated filters might prevent a qualified candidate from even being considered. In this case, I wasn\\u2019t trying to bypass anyone maliciously, just ensuring my resume landed in the right hands. The CEO could have ignored my message, but instead, he encouraged me to apply, which tells me that direct outreach\\u2014when done respectfully\\u2014can sometimes work in a candidate\\u2019s favor. That said, I totally understand that not every company or hiring manager will view it the same way, and it\\u2019s a risk job seekers have to weigh.\\n| | | WinOk4525 (1 upvotes): It doesn\\u2019t matter if you bypassed people maliciously or not. You bypassed everyone between HR and the CEO. You made them all look incompetent and bad at their jobs. These are the people who ultimately will decide if you get hired or not. If they hire you it will confirm with the CEO that they can\\u2019t properly do their job. Why should the CEO continue to employee the HR/Managers if they are so bad at their jobs that qualified  applicants go directly to him and avoid those whose responsibility it is to do the job?\\n| | | | Ok_Design_705 (2 upvotes): Ok, let\'s rein it in a bit. In my post I say \\"I reached out directly to the job poster\\u2014who also happened to be the company\\u2019s CEO.\\" I hope this clarifies things for you.\\n| | | | | WinOk4525 (1 upvotes): So you did nothing out of the ordinary when applying for this position? What\\u2019s the point of this post then? Someone posted a job, that person happened to be the CEO, you sent the job poster your resume? What\\u2019s different about what you did here than anyone else would have done?\\n| LeRosbif49 (3 upvotes): I almost never apply through LinkedIn and instead apply directly with the company, with absolutely no success whatsoever.\\n| Full_Firefighter6970 (3 upvotes): This worked for me before! I got an interview, didn\\u2019t make it to next round but wouldn\\u2019t have made it to that stage without messaging the hiring manager that I figured out via snooping who it was\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (2 upvotes): Glad it worked for you to get an interview. Have you continued using that strategy, or was it a once off?\\n| | | Full_Firefighter6970 (1 upvotes): Just tried it once, would def do again but took time off the job search\\n| IAMNUMBERBLACK (5 upvotes): It\\u2019s what we recommend and do all the time over in r/sales and that takes courage, good job OP!\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (2 upvotes): Thank you. I have just checked out r/sales. There are some great tips there!\\n| DeadStarCaster (2 upvotes): What do you usually say? I lack some experience but I always keep learning\\n| NoDryHands (2 upvotes): From what I\'ve seen, LinkedIn job postings rarely show the poster. They usually hide that, probably because they get so many people reaching out to them like this. I\'ve seen only a handful of listings that actually shows the person in charge of hiring for that role.\\n| SaaSFounder01 (2 upvotes): Good advice but there are also software that help do this\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (2 upvotes): Please name a few, and I will check them out. This will benefit other people reading your comment.\\n| | | [deleted] (1 upvotes): [deleted]\\n| | | | Ok_Design_705 (1 upvotes): But my post wasn\'t about tailoring resumes. So your vague initial comment was to gain an opening so that you can freely advertise your product?\\n| | | | | SaaSFounder01 (1 upvotes): It is honestly not the best way to start emailing company HR and CEOs. You got very lucky, as it worked for you. How many will respond to this? We get tons of such msgs for jobs we advertise and we are unable to respond. I have personally done this in the past when I was a jobseeker and never got replies. My point is the credentials you had such as certifications etc have to be highlighted for example in cover letter and make sure none are missing, and if they are, the AI tool  should highlight it. Your job application has to be the strongest it can be and my point was there are tools for that.  If you feel sharing a tool that does this is advertising, I did not want to mention it and will delete my comment. I have made a separate post so people can read and try for themselves\\n| SoupRyze (2 upvotes): Do you mind if I dm you to learn more about your transition to Cybersecurity? I am also looking to transition into it but not sure where to start.\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (1 upvotes): Sure. I am happy to help where I can.\\n| yossi234 (2 upvotes): May I ask how old you are? How long did it take to make the change into cybersecurity? Feel free to DM me if this is sensitive info. Thanks!\\n| | Visible-Mess-2375 (1 upvotes): Why does their age matter?\\n| Visible-Mess-2375 (2 upvotes): This is the exception, not the rule. I\\u2019m guessing this is a pretty small company if the CEO is also the job poster. You need to be up front about this. In general, hiring managers will either ghost you completely or tell you to \\u201capply online like everyone else.\\u201d  In fact, many companies now have \\u201cdo not contact\\u201d disclaimers right in the JDs, and warn that candidates who attempt contact anyway will be automatically disqualified and possibly even face permanent blacklisting.   So congrats to you for getting lucky, but I wouldn\\u2019t recommend this approach as a viable long-term strategy.\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (1 upvotes): Thanks.       What wasn\\u2019t I upfront about? My post isn\\u2019t telling people to reach out to CEOs\\u2014it\\u2019s about being strategic when applying, especially when automated filters might eliminate you before a human even reviews your application. In this case, the job poster *happened* to be the CEO, and he responded positively. I agree this won\\u2019t work for every company, but neither does blindly applying and hoping for the best. Job seekers have to adapt, experiment, and find what works for them.\\n| youknowmetoo_2000 (2 upvotes): Is this that merit process I keep hearing about.. lol. Good luck, and I hope it works out.\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (1 upvotes): Hahaha, I had to Google the merit-process! Thank you.\\n| Icy-Sympathy-1446 (2 upvotes): I think it would be very helpful to tell us what the content of your message was.\\n| FarmerScott1 (2 upvotes): Absolutely.  I often hear people say: \\" they sent of 100\'s of resumes! \\"  Sometims you have to find a way to get to the gate keepers...which many times is someone in HR. If I don\'t know the name of the HR person, I have even gone to the company and waited outside the door to be able to approach someone for the name of the HR person!\\n| | mackfactor (2 upvotes): \\"They had us in the first half, I\'m not going to lie.gif\\"\\n| Ok_Ant8450 (-1 downvotes): You dont actually explain what you did\\n| | Ok_Design_705 (4 upvotes): I thought I did.

This is the way. Far too many people passively job search with no strategy or intention.  They don\\u2019t educate themselves on what works and what doesn\\u2019t, then post how they\\u2019ve \\u201capplied to 1,926 jobs and still unemployed after a year.\\u201d  Sometimes it\\u2019s not the job market that\\u2019s to blame, it\\u2019s the jobseeker.

There is a preference for names that are easy to say, especially short ones.  I\'m a white American, but my mom got fancy (and was high) and gave me an unusual first name that makes people think I\'m not from here. Like people have point-blank asked me, \\"What are you?\\" Rude. I had a hell of a time using my legal name trying to get a job. I didn\'t get a job until I started using my nickname. I\'m known by my nickname and use it on application materials unless it specifically says \\"legal name.\\" Generally you don\'t have to disclose legal name until they actually hire you or at least after they\'ve interviewed you, and by then they already know you by the nickname and the bias is less.

Yes, bc most people have unexamined biases so best to exploit it in this case.\\n| | DeliciousResist1011 (1 upvotes): lol this is what i told my friends; my last name might give me away unfortunately\\n| pop-crackle (4 upvotes): My husband does something like this, although it\\u2019s because he goes by his middle name.

I only ever provide my legal name for paperwork and tax purposes (ex. when I had to fill out my I-9 and withholding forms). In the job searching phase, my legal name was never even brought up.

That\\u2019s the only time I\\u2019d say to use the local address.

That\\u2019s the biggest thing. I\\u2019ve lied to relocate for my last two roles and had housing already setup with family. It was fine.  But also as someone who\\u2019s lived on the east coast, housing prices are insane. So you need to secure that before you accept an offer.\\n| Least_Maximum_7524 (2 upvotes): UPS store or iPostal at Staples has worked for me to keep a stable address and presence in the US while I\\u2019m globetrotting. You can also get a local phone number on Burner or whatever. Not the same as your situation, but an idea. You have to be ready to move immediately, though.  Some people disagree, but I don\\u2019t think anyone needs to know where you live. I really guard that info.\\n| JenniferMcKay (2 upvotes): Do not put a local address on your applications.  For one thing, it\'s extremely easy for them to find out you\'re lying.  \\\\- When they try to schedule a meeting with you and find out you\'re in another time zone.  \\\\- When they try to schedule an interview but it\'s too short notice for you to book travel over 2,000 miles.  \\\\- When you have to delay the start date so you can move 2,000 miles.  \\\\- When you show up for your first day and your ID has an address in an entirely different state.  If it\'s your resume, take the address off completely. If address is a required field and you can do a cover letter, briefly mention that you attended college there and intend to relocate back as soon as possible. That should soothe any worries that you\'re applying to jobs that aren\'t remote intending to work remotely.\\n| Queasy_Author_3810 (1 upvotes): Do not lie about your address. Just, don\'t. Just be clear you\'re open to relocation, even put it on your resume if you\'d like. But don\'t lie and put an address you do not live in on there. The odds of that having a positive impact vs a negative one is very lobsided.\\n| CaptainLee9137 (1 upvotes): I\\u2019ve done it once, you just have to be ready to be at the desired location.

I\\u2019ve accepted that. But why on earth do companies think it\\u2019s a good idea to send rejection emails on a Sunday (even if automated)? Like, let me enjoy my one day of peace before another week of job searching and waiting for responses. I\\u2019m out here trying to relax, maybe pretend I\\u2019m not stressing about finding a job, and then boom! Sunday morning rejection. Like\\u2026 do recruiters schedule these in advance? Anyway, just needed to rant. Anyone else been hit with the weekend rejection special?\\n\\n53 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At least for the jobs I apply to.\\n| | OneMegaGamer (4 upvotes): Technically speaking, Bangladesh weekends are Friday and Saturday. The rejection hurts even more\\n| | | Top_Argument8442 (1 upvotes): I was speaking to the time difference.\\n| | | | fender8421 (2 upvotes): That hit me hard when I moved across the IDL before my birthday. Cost me like 12hours of my 20\'s\\n| Dismal-Refrigerator3 (13 upvotes): Forget about Sunday\'s I\'ve recieved them on Christmas.\\n| | FlimsyRabbit4502 (3 upvotes): So did I \\ud83e\\udd72\\n| | a_lovelylight (2 upvotes): I normally don\'t care either way, but today\'s my birthday so seeing two rejections this Sunday morning burned a little, lmao. I\'m in my mid-30s and my career is dead. Have also received xmas rejections. Fun. Wish this market would improve.\\n| 757Lemon (20 upvotes): The newest thing I\'ve come across are the rejection emails that come in OVERNIGHT. Like between 1am to 4am! I am on the east coast in the US and only applying to US jobs - most of which are on the east coast, so it always baffles me when I wake up and see I got a rejection email from a company at 2:27 AM.  I\'d say at least 1/3 of the rejection emails I\'ve gotten in the past 6 weeks have come between midnight and 6 AM.\\n| | Final_Prune3903 (10 upvotes): At my last company I was a recruiter and fit some reason our automatic rejections went out at about 1 am. We used workday. It was a big company so I wasn\\u2019t part of the configuration so not sure if it\\u2019s an option we picked or just standard for workday.\\n| | | BunchAlternative6172 (1 upvotes): Probably set from the company as each have their own workday. So, even so, the sick freak that does it needs a punch in the face.\\n| | cheradenine66 (2 upvotes): It\'s daytime in India then\\n| | Opposite-Rough-5845 (1 upvotes): Which makes you wonder if the job posting was even real.\\n| RoughChi-GTF (10 upvotes): They work so hard on Sundays to review applications and resumes, though.\\n| | CollectionComplex861 (7 upvotes): That made me giggle :D\\n| | Plastic_Proof_8347 (2 upvotes): I actually received an interview invitation on a Saturday and it was a legitimate one. The recruiter was sweet and thoughtful but I felt bad for her that she had to reach out to a candidate on a Saturday.  They changed their mind at the last minute after giving me a verbal offer that the company paused hiring for this position, but I\'m still in touch with the recruiter. It seemed like the company was pretty chaotic, so everything makes sense.\\n| FlimsyRabbit4502 (5 upvotes): I think its even worse when you are getting rejection emails back to back\\ud83e\\udd72\\n| Latter-Fisherman-268 (8 upvotes): I was getting them on Christmas of all days lol\\n| | ella003 (4 upvotes): I got one on Christmas Eve.

I interviewed for a job on Tuesday, February 4th.  The recruiter told me they\'d have a meeting with the hiring manager and have a response for me by \\"early next week.\\" They sent the canned rejection email on Saturday, March 8th!\\n| BizznectApp (7 upvotes): Sunday rejection emails should be illegal. Let me at least pretend for one day that my life isn\\u2019t a series of \\u2018we regret to inform you\\u2019 messages\\n| SaintPatrickMahomes (5 upvotes): Every rejection is a step forward. You know the saying about leave no stone unturned?  That\\u2019s another stone you turned over.\\n| | GenericUsername2034 (1 upvotes): If every rejection is a step forward - I have circumnavigated the globe...and still remain in my current position..\\n| | | SaintPatrickMahomes (1 upvotes): Same. Sadly for me. I\\u2019m trying to stay positive though and push forward.\\n| | Texas_Nexus (1 upvotes): Many of us are so far forward at this point we\'re out of stones.

I try not to let it get to me though. Honestly these ATS tools don\'t know me, and statistics show that hiring managers are less accurate than pure chance in terms of predicting who will be successful in a role, so.\\n| Southern_One3791 (2 upvotes): I got one Dec. 25th. Made it look like it came from a real person, but I doubt that.\\n| ExpressionDapper7526 (2 upvotes): I\\u2019m soooooo sick of people on this forum not listening to advice from someone on the inside of the fight for regulations in AI Talent Software.  I\\u2019ve posted 1,000 times. I\\u2019ve explained how the ACLU needs to hear from people other than me!!! Going in circles in these forums is wasting energy and getting guesses as to why when the reason has been researched through and through.  They need to know how many people are impacted, for how long and the extent of impact. Visit my page and you can either sign the change petition or join the forum and share your story.  I meet with the ACLU and all I have are the numbers of people signing the petition. ZERO HUMANS. Which is why we aren\\u2019t being treated as humans.  We don\\u2019t exist\\n| Tall_latte23 (1 upvotes): Rejection emails aren\\u2019t generally scheduled and come randomly. My rejections have been sent on any day of the week between the hours of 7am and 8pm on average.\\n| initialsareabc (1 upvotes): I got an auto generated one on Saturday morning at 6:30am. \\ud83e\\udee0\\n| Longjumping_Rain_483 (1 upvotes): I got 5 on my birthday (a Friday). Crazy coincidence I guess\\n| Flnewcomer500 (1 upvotes): I also think it\\u2019s chicken shit to send them out at 4:55 on Friday.\\n| MissMelines (1 upvotes): Hahaha! Just received my first this morning bright and early, found it so strange.  First application to get any response though, so I\\u2019m feeling pumped about that y\\u2019know\\n| Succinate_dehydrogen (1 upvotes): Eh, who am I to say what hours they\'re allowed to work. Don\'t check your emails/have them filtered into a separate folder.  An important skill in the modern interconnected world is figuring out how to properly isolate yourself so you can switch off.\\n| Tigerlily86_ (1 upvotes): Yeah it sucks\\u00a0\\n| TheGOODSh-tCo (1 upvotes): Really shouldn\\u2019t be focused on what time they send them. I end up having to work on things like this on weekends, as do many other overworked staff.  As someone who has been laid off 3x by the same company in 5 years, I know it sucks to wake up to rejection emails, but it sucks getting them anytime.  At least it\\u2019s follow up.  There\\u2019s simply not one way to do it that will please everyone, bc recruiting is not standardized. Many companies offer flexible work schedules so their team can go pick up kids from school etc. Weekend rejections are actually more of an indicator they offer flexible work options.\\n| SpacePolice04 (1 upvotes): I created a separate email address for job crap so I can still check my regular email without getting random rejections mixed in.\\n| LittleVante (1 upvotes): I\\u2019ve been hit with weekend rejections and rejection emails at 1am or 2am \\ud83d\\udc80\\n| lithium-ink (1 upvotes): This is sadly a configuration of the ATS system. They will parse through the candidates, and whomever the recruiter or manager disqualify, it goes into a queue and that queue is scheduled to email out on a specific time and day. Sadly, they use the default which is probably 6am on Sunday.  I have seen this set up during some of the hiring I have had to do. It is poorly set up. This also explains why you will get a rejection email 15 to 30 minutes after applying at 2am. The business is so lazy they won\'t even configure their hiring software proper.\\n| ella003 (1 upvotes): Bc you\\u2019re in the US and they\\u2019re in India\\n| VibrantGypsyDildo (-2 downvotes): Sounds like a you problem.   I always treated 3 days of silence as a reason to apply more.\\n| TemperatureCommon185 (-4 downvotes): Jeez Louise, do you the world revolves are your schedule?  Kinda reminds me of an episode of \\"Hogan\'s Heroes\\".  Colonel Klink finds out the allies are invading, and his response was \\"At this hour?\\"\\n| | Texas_Nexus (2 upvotes): Your analogy is kind of a good one because in this hiring hellscape the employers have waged war against candidates and their own employees. That\'s why if it seems as though they are doing every cruel and soulless thing possible to us - it\'s because they intentionally are. They view us as the enemy standing between them and their endless profits and control over us, so they are doing everything possible to demoralize us so we are willing to return to the pre-pandemic status quo where we surrender our entire lives back over to them for the least amount possible.\\n| S101custom (-2 downvotes): Of all the things to be frustrated about in this job market, you chose the day of week rejection emails are sent?  I\'m sure your search has been arduous, but I think you gotta fixate on more pertinent aspects.\\n| _Casey_ (0 upvotes): Not gonna please everyone. Someone\'s gonna complain if you send it Monday or Wed or Fri. Just gotta learn to deal w/ rejections. Part of life.

One of the over 100 companies I\'ve applied to since July, a reinsurance company, offered me a final round interview for an early career reinsurance position...only to reject despite the interview going pretty ok IMO. It sucked, but at the time I was at least like \\"Welp, it was either me or someone else, guess I lost out\\". A few weeks later, someone from that same company reaches out to me by phone, and politely informs me that the company recruiters saw my resume on file and not only were interested in my apparent skills, but offered me a final round interview without having to do any Hirevue nonsense, and I just have to apply for the position to get the interview. Awesome! I look over the position, looks ok for a starting job, and apply, and the final round interview honestly goes really well. I\'m honestly hopeful at the time...only to get a big fat rejection by email. As in, they literally reached out to me, got me all hopeful and gave me a free final round interview without any preceding interview required, only to reject me all the same. Like, why the fuck did you even bother getting my hopes up like that?

They actually found you good enough to bypass a whole chunk of their process, and get you to the final stage. They didn\'t promise you the job -- they provided you an expedited shot at the job.  And someone else was better. I get that it is disappointing to not get the offer, but you act like they did you an injustice, when they gave you more of a fast track to the final verdict. You are the one that got your hopes up.  All they promised was an interview, and they delivered. I hope you are able to get more expedited interviews, and that you\'ll get an offer out of one of them soon.\\n| rob4lb (2 upvotes): The interviewing is good experience.   You may not be as effective as you think.   Given that you have a relationship with the company, ask for feedback.\\n| Longjumping-Date-181 (1 upvotes): At this point in your career I recommend waiting to jump, I get your current job sucks, but you\'ll be vastly better off with a couple years experience.  3, 7 and 15 years from entering the work force seem to be the ideal points to jump from what i have seen.\\n| Hairy_Imagination636 (1 upvotes): Hi OP, sorry about that mess the company put you through. Went through a similar situation myself with 2 different companies only for them to reject me both at the end.  I would say keep your current job and keep applying but don\'t be discouraged. I graduated with an economics degree from a state school and went through 4 career pivots (< 10 year career). Started as account executive in sales, then pivoted to a paralegal role, then financial analyst and now working in product.  You will eventually find a role that you love. I went through at least 50 rejections (made it to different rounds of interviews) and hundreds of auto rejects. There was a period where I had 3 final rounds and all 3 companies rejected me. A few months later, all 3 companies had company wide layoffs. (Blessing in disguise) Don\'t be discouraged! What kept me going was telling myself that \\"whatever is meant for me will be for me.\\"\\n| Infamous-Cattle-1993 (1 upvotes): Universal Studios Japan did this to me.

I held onto that horrible job until I found another job.  Never quit a job cold unless you have something lined up.   I hope you find something soon.  I hope you learned a lesson.\\n| | IslandImpressive6850 (5 upvotes): \\"I hope you learned a lesson\\" no shit smartass, he has been regretting that since the first time he missed a check.\\n| | | tanhauser_gates_ (-1 downvotes): He still maintains he doesn\'t regret it.\\n| | | | IslandImpressive6850 (2 upvotes): Maybe he was getting raped by the manager or something.\\n| | Kingmarvelfan (1 upvotes): No I still don\\u2019t regret honestly if I have to repeat in another life I would still do it again  Sorry to hear about that and half you found a job you like and hopefully I found a job that doesn\\u2019t treat me like garbage\\n| SFAdminLife (1 upvotes): I\\u2019m curious where you found research that made you think that businesses are desperate for workers?

I signed up thinking it was a legit AI-powered job application service that would help streamline my job search. They make it sound super professional on their website, promising tailored applications, CV optimization, and all that. But once they took my money, it was a completely different story. First of all, **the service is nothing like they advertise** \\u2014 I got generic, low-quality cover letters that looked like they were copy-pasted from templates. Absolutely **zero personalization**, and honestly, I could have done a better job myself in 10 minutes. Secondly, **their \\"AI\\" seems fake**. It doesn\'t adapt to the job descriptions you give them. I even tried giving them super specific roles and the responses I got were laughably off-topic. The worst part? **Customer support is non-existent**. The moment you complain or ask for a refund, they just ghost you. No replies to emails, no way to get in touch with a real human.\\n\\n11 Comments:\\n--------\\n| Rude_Rest4828 (19 upvotes): I mean there\'s plenty of free services that do this sort of stuff for free. I don\'t think there\'s any AI right now that will personalize your cover letter as well as a human can\\n| GayHungry4D (11 upvotes): Just do a chargeback for the transaction.\\n| jhkoenig (7 upvotes): Sadly, these AI \\"pay to play\\" services seem to be scams.

STOP doing this.\\n| VellDarksbane (1 upvotes): AI is a scam, why would anything claiming to be \\"AI\\" be any different?\\n| Alternative_Emu9369 (0 upvotes): There is a company that provides personal assistants for job applications at hourly rates.

I\'m looking for a new job, and I quickly noticed how overwhelming it could become\\u2014applications piling up, networking conversations getting lost, and interview schedules becoming hard to manage. I tried using Google Sheets and Excel, but they felt clunky and quickly got disorganized. So I created a job application, a tool designed to simplify and streamline the entire job search process. I\'m offering this [job application tracker](http://nextroleapp.com) for free in exchange for your feedback on how to improve it. Here\'s how it\'s helping me (and could help you!) land the next great job: \\u2705 **Clearly Define and Rank Target Companies.** Instead of randomly applying everywhere, I built a ranked list of my top 12 target companies, allowing me to prioritize roles that genuinely align with my career goals. \\ud83d\\udccc **Stay on Top of Every Job Application.** I\'m currently managing 4 active applications, and the Kanban board clearly shows me each application\'s stage. This visual organization keeps me motivated and helps me refine my approach based on what\\u2019s working best. \\ud83d\\udcde **Effortlessly Manage Networking.** Networking can significantly increase your chances of getting noticed for a job, offering valuable referrals and firsthand insights about companies you\'re interested in. I\'ve identified key contacts to tap into their knowledge and support. The tracker even includes an AI-powered intro message feature that helps personalize my outreach, making the entire networking process less intimidating and more effective. I built this tracker because I wanted a better, more intuitive way to organize my job search, but I know everyone\'s needs are different. I\'m currently looking for feedback from other job seekers who are interested in trying this tool for free. Your suggestions will help me tailor and improve the tracker to better meet your needs.

I\'d like to see if it\'s helpful to anyone else and if it can be improved.       Yes, you\'re right, likely it will be $5-10 for lifetime usage. If it\'s a useful tool then it should be paid for. We spend our time and money to build these products, either people pay money for them, or companies sell your data to make money. It\'s the way it works. Do you think Reddit is free?

Sorry just needed to vent, I\\u2019m feeling kinda hurt about this interview I had, but I\\u2019m just a sensitive person. I had a very negative interview experience for an internship. The interviewer was asking me very negative questions\\u2014nothing about my strengths, skills, work experience, or class experience. I also had to make my own zoom link, never had that happen before but maybe it\\u2019s more common than I think idk. Yeah, she asked the basic things like, \\u201cWhat are your weaknesses or negative traits?\\u201d and \\u201cWhat was the last mistake you made?\\u201d but also strange questions (in my opinion) like, \\u201cWhy shouldn\\u2019t we hire you?\\u201d and \\u201cWhat did your parents say was your bad behavior growing up?\\u201d Which caught me a little off guard. I could tell she was just writing in her notes everything that was wrong with me and why I shouldn\\u2019t get the job. Overall, I think I answered the questions well, tried to turn them into something positive, and explained how I\\u2019m working on my flaws. Even when she asked me, \\u201cWhy shouldn\\u2019t we hire you?\\u201d I wanted to hang up so bad lol. Edit: She was also asking, if I ever ran into their products and things like that. I think that type of question is very annoying because dude I just want a job. I\\u2019m not some consumer, I literally found out about your company when I saw the job posting that you literally reached out for me to apply. \\n\\n10 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think you had the right strategy: trying to make negatives into a positive. Even so, thats a seriously fucked up interview path of questioning. It reminds me of my first job interview straight out of uni over 30 years ago. Third question: \\"Are you a misogynist ?\\"..... no word of a lie.... my answer to that was \\"My mother and younger sisters don\'t think so\\".\\n| | cringeanato (9 upvotes): It was spring meadow nursery.\\n| | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (6 upvotes): This was an internship for a NURSERY?!  Fuck them, I think they did you a favor. As others have said on here so far, leave reviews on Glassdoor. Also, you\\u2019re not being sensitive at all. The fact you made it through the interview means you\\u2019re a strong person.  Best of luck, you\\u2019ll find the right one soon.\\n| | | | cringeanato (2 upvotes): Yea it was. Thank you. I wasn\\u2019t sure if that was normal. I haven\\u2019t been through hundreds of interviews but these were some of the most annoying questions I\\u2019ve encountered.  It actually made me tear up after. It\\u2019s been hard looking for an internship and then you think you\\u2019re prepared but encounter another form of bs\\n| | | | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (3 upvotes): I am so sorry to hear that!! Hugs to you (sorry if this is weird, but I feel the need to hug people when I see them cry lol) But that is NOT normal. When I read your post, I was thinking this HAS to be a joke. Typically they\\u2019ll throw in the \\u201cwhat are your weaknesses?\\u201d \\u201cWhat mistakes did you make and what did you do to fix it?\\u201d kind of questions, but to make it the entire interview is a big red ass flag. I don\\u2019t get why they need to know how you were as a child, you\\u2019re a fucking adult now and it\\u2019s none of their business with how you were raised.  Sorry, now I\\u2019m getting triggered for you \\ud83d\\ude02\\n| | | sfc-Juventino (3 upvotes): I don\'t know who they are and in what part of the world you are in, but you\'ve been warned, people. Avoid these nutjobs like the plague. I hope you find somewhere that treats you like a respectible human being.\\n| srswings (4 upvotes): There should be maybe 1 question like that and the bad behavior one is just stupid and pointless. Bad interviewer. I\\u2019d give them a Glassdoor review and just reshare exactly what you e posted here.\\n| WROL (2 upvotes): The script for this is \\u201care you feeling ok?\\u201d Then hang up and inform their manager if possible.\\u00a0\\n| Boring_Albatross_354 (2 upvotes): I\\u2019ve felt like this more and more during interviews. Downplaying accomplishments, making your work experience feel inferior if it was on a smaller scale. Almost like they are point out \\u201cdeficiencies\\u201d in order to have more excuses to severely low ball you if they even offer a job.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1jd487r'}, {'title': 'Unconventional Interview Experiences and Follow-ups', 'text': '{"text":"Title: Denied job, but got reached back out to to apply\\nAuthor: Calm_Artichoke8318\\nUpvotes: 14\\nBody text: As the title states, I had interviewed for a position back in late December and didn\\u2019t get the job. However, the hiring manager emailed me personally stating she was \\u201creally impressed\\u201d with my previous interview and that she\\u2019d \\u201clove\\u201d for me to reapply for the position and gave me the direct link. My immediate thought is THEN WHY DIDN\\u2019T YOU HIRE ME?! But I do realize there are reasons behind the scenes of why this may happen. It was just frustrating at the moment.  This is the very first time this has happened to me. My mental health has been crumbling the last few months and this gave me SOME hope and gained a bit in my self esteem. I was just curious if this has happened to anyone before and what the outcome ended up being?  Edit: I applied the second I saw this email because I\\u2019m desperate right now, but just wanted to hear others experiences with this situation. \\n\\n39 Comments:\\n--------\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes): The discord for our subreddit can be found here: https://discord.gg/JjNdBkVGc6 - feel free to join us for a more realtime level of discussion! *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They did contact you again, that\\u2019s a good sign. It\\u2019s better than starving, yes?\\u00a0\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (8 upvotes): Oh, I applied the second I saw the email \\ud83d\\ude02 dang I thought I included that on here, so I\\u2019ll edit this, thank you for this lol\\n| | | WROL (7 upvotes): No worries.

There are a lot of talented people competing for a few roles, and you might have been a runner up that they really wished they could have extended an offer to. I think it\\u2019s a great sign that you got a personal email - good luck!\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): Yeah the sloppy seconds comment didn\\u2019t really help \\ud83d\\ude05 But I appreciate your kind words! Thank you so much \\ud83d\\ude0a\\n| | | DeliciousTea6683 (5 upvotes): Oh, and to answer your actual question, something similar has happened to me. Not a direct email from the hiring manager, but the recruiter called me to invite me to reapply and I ended up getting the job.\\n| | | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): Oh that\\u2019s awesome!! I really hope this happens to me because if I get rejected again, my mental health is legit going to go even further down the rabbit hole (right term?lol) and I can\\u2019t afford therapy right now. Luckily, I have my husband and family as my support system, but I try not to talk to them about this because I don\\u2019t want them to worry about me too much.\\n| | | | | DeliciousTea6683 (2 upvotes): I know, I get it. I\\u2019m sorry you\\u2019re going through this. I promise it will happen. Try to stay off this sub, tbh. Lots of miserable people here who can\\u2019t find a job for good reason - it just kind of becomes doomscrolling.\\n| Narrow_Literature462 (6 upvotes): I\\u2019ve had plenty of some strong 2nd place candidates when I only had one role to fill. It may sting to not get hired but that doesn\\u2019t mean they didn\\u2019t like you or you won\\u2019t be a fit there - just means you weren\\u2019t the best fit at that time.\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (1 upvotes): If you don\\u2019t mind me asking, what do you look at to have you officially decide to go with that candidate versus the other? I\\u2019m assuming you\\u2019re a hiring manager lol  But that\\u2019s I\\u2019m trying to tell myself now, so getting this email honestly helped me feel a lot better about myself because it has been literal hell for me the last few months.\\n| | | Narrow_Literature462 (3 upvotes): All depends on the role. Sometimes one candidate has more experience with some important software, or maybe they have to lead a difficult team and while they are technically A+ they haven\\u2019t dealt with that before and the other candidate has. Honestly it could be anything that edges someone out.  But what I would focus on is they reached out to you. While that should mean they think you are a good fit you are still going up against other people so treat it like any other interview - meaning do your research about the company, what issues they face that you can fix, examples of your accomplishments that you can use during your interview, and some meaningful questions for them that shows you are serious about the role.\\n| | | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (1 upvotes): Ah, that makes sense. Thank you for sharing that. It\\u2019s just every time I\\u2019ve been getting job rejections, I just question what was it I didn\\u2019t meet by the end of the interview.  The sad part is I had this exact same role at another institution, from a university, and this is a community college. I have 8+ years of experience in the field and the education in the state I moved to is awful, so I just didn\\u2019t understand what it was.\\n| daydreamz4dayz (1 upvotes): The person they chose got a better offer and left lol\\n| Jealous_Glove_9391 (1 upvotes): Yup just reapply and be prepared the best you can, all the best\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): Thank you!\\n| SilverRoseBlade (1 upvotes): Def apply! And I would also email back saying thank you, that you did apply and are still interested in the role. Never know if theyll send a note to the recruiter to pull your app to the top of the list.\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): I had to make an edit to this post to say I applied the second I saw the email and def responded to let her know that I did, and of course thanked her.\\n| zzbear03 (1 upvotes): I don\\u2019t understand the need for them to have you reapply \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffe\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f don\\u2019t they already have your info? Did the job description change?\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): I think it\\u2019s just part of the process and I think they\\u2019re hiring an additional staff for the same position.\\n| Different_Pianist756 (1 upvotes): Happened to me before, rejected for original job, called unexpectedly with an offer for the same position on a different team.\\u00a0\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (1 upvotes): Did you get the job?\\n| | | Different_Pianist756 (1 upvotes): Yes, I took it! They just flat out offered it to me without another interview.\\u00a0\\n| | | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (1 upvotes): That\\u2019s awesome!! Ugh I wish this could be me. Because I had to do a presentation for this interview and would rather not do it again \\ud83d\\ude43 going off of her saying she was \\u201creally impressed\\u201d, I\\u2019m hoping I won\\u2019t have to but lot getting my hopes up lol\\n| | | | | Different_Pianist756 (1 upvotes): Yes, you just never know, so stay positive (but still somewhat detached). When it happened to me, it was more than 6 weeks after my original interview. I had to fight my ego to tell them to buzz off, but it was worth it.\\u00a0 No matter what, something good will find you.\\u00a0\\n| NightGod (1 upvotes): Could be anything. The first person hired left, died, committed a crime, got sick, lied about something on their resume, had a terrible personality conflict, had addiction issues, turned out to have swastika tattoos and a framed pic of Adolf on his desk or as simple as they\'re expanding the program and remembered you enough to think you\'d still be a great fit at the school. I certainly wouldn\'t ask right away, but I would probably bring it up during an interview in that whole \\"do you have any questions for us?\\" portion of the pageant broadcast\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): That got a good laugh out of me lol but that\\u2019s what I was thinking of doing, waiting until the questions at the end. I wasn\\u2019t going to ask directly, and it\\u2019ll probably be 50/50 if they\\u2019ll actually address it but I was going to say something along the lines of thank you so much for another opportunity and how I was surprised to see her email because it\\u2019s never happened to me before. But maybe I should leave that second half out lol\\n| | | NightGod (1 upvotes): \\\\*MY\\\\* approach would be something like, \\"I typically ask this question anyway, but I admit I have some added curiosity in this case: why is this position currently open?\\"\\n| | | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (2 upvotes): Ahh, I\\u2019ll def keep this in mind. I just want them to freaking offer me the job dammit lol but again thanks for the good laugh earlier lol\\n| | | | | NightGod (2 upvotes): Yeah, the thread was getting a little heavy and needed some joy because, in the long run, this is a GOOD thing for you!\\n| rob4lb (0 upvotes): Why are you asking people\\u2019s opinions, go ahead and reapply.  Do you have any better prospects?  You apparently have an advocate on the inside.\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (1 upvotes): I made an edit to this post and said I did apply the second I saw the email lol I am absolutely desperate and was NOT going to give this up.  Idk why I didn\\u2019t include that initially in my post \\ud83e\\udd26\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f I just wanted to hear other people\\u2019s experiences with this.\\n| AuthenticTruther (-1 downvotes): Translation: \\"We fucked up. Please come back\\" Do you want to be sloppy seconds?\\n| | Calm_Artichoke8318 (3 upvotes): That was my other thought too.  And of course not. I just need a job right now and unfortunately I didn\\u2019t qualify for unemployment, so I\\u2019m desperate. I really want to ask them why they\\u2019re offering this again, but we\\u2019ll see.\\n| | | AuthenticTruther (1 upvotes): Just go for it, it could have been an honest mistake. Don\'t let pride hold you back, just keep your guard up. God bless.\\n| | | | Calm_Artichoke8318 (1 upvotes): I\\u2019m just trying to think positive at this point because I can\\u2019t do these mental breakdowns anymore, and I just feel for people so much in my situation.  I\\u2019m definitely going to take this second opportunity, so we\\u2019ll see. Thank you so much.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1jcza2m'}]

However, I just received another offer that is significantly higher in pay and fully remote. The new offer is contingent on a background check and drug screening, which I should pass without issue. I\\u2019m feeling anxious about the job market, but I also want to make the best decision for my future. Assuming the new employer won\\u2019t see that I started my original job before the checks are complete, how do I professionally navigate this situation? \\t1.\\tShould I wait for the contingencies to clear before quitting the first position? \\t2.\\tHow do I professionally inform the job I\\u2019m supposed to start tomorrow that I will no longer be joining? \\t3.\\tAre there any potential risks I should consider in making this switch? I want to handle this with integrity while also making the best choice for myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\\n\\n12 Comments:\\n--------\\n| oakandbarrel (95 upvotes): 1. Yes, I would start your new job as planned tomorrow, make a good impression. Wait until everything is finalized with your other offer before resigning. It might take a week or two before your new start date.  2. You should be completely honest. You won\\u2019t be the first or the last person to do this, and realistically they will forget about you in a week or two. Being honest and transparent at least shows character and might leave the door open for future opportunity at that company. Any decent person will not fault you for taking a better offer for yourself.  3. Only risk I would question with the second offer - are you familiar with the company? Small reg flag if both offers are for the same role as to why the second is so much better.  Congrats on both offers!\\n| | extrasass_inthegrass (8 upvotes): Thank you I will most definitely be doing this! I still haven\\u2019t completely committed to the other offer so it will be good to see how the first role is anyways.\\n| False-Panic3893 (34 upvotes): 1. Yes 2. You just tell them the truth. You were very excited about this opportunity, but one of the roles you interviewed for has come to you with an offer you can\\u2019t turn down.  3. Don\\u2019t put the temporary job on your resume.  Make sure you weigh the full offer/total comp. (Base salary, bonuses, cost of benefits, 401k/HSA match, etc)\\n| Degen_Boy (40 upvotes): 100% wait for everything to clear. Tell the current job that a family or health issue has arisen and you need to resign, they are not legally allowed to ask questions. Do not put it in your resume at any point in the future. The only risk is the better job falling through, but that\\u2019s a risk with every job.\\n| NumeracyNinja (10 upvotes): Definitely wait until the second job is secured. Just never know what might happen. Generally there is a 3 month probation period when starting a new job, that is for you and the employer if things don\\u2019t work. If the second job comes through just have an honest conversation with them. They might come back with a counter offer for you, everyone understands you need to put yourself and your future first. If they get mad, well you just dodged a bullet.\\n| Bianconeagles (5 upvotes): Don\'t quit until you have a start date and all the paperwork is done for your new role. When the time comes, apologize to them and tell them that you will be pursuing a different opportunity.\\n| WavyGravyBoat (4 upvotes): This happened to me once.  I shafted the first job and took the second one and lived to regret it.  There was about $10,000 difference in the pay.  The boss was crazy and every day was a living hell, then he fired me because I left the light on in the kitchen.\\n| | extrasass_inthegrass (1 upvotes): I\\u2019m so worried this will happen to me lol.\\n| clael415 (1 upvotes): This happened to me a few years ago, I received an offer on my first day of another new job. I waited a week or so for everything to be confirmed and then spoke to the current employer. I was completely honest and although they were disappointed it was as amicable as it could have been. I was more embarrassed than anything. There are plenty of people out there who are understanding, and if someone is upset at you for doing the best thing for you and your family then that\\u2019s a reflection of them.\\n| R0ck3tSc13nc3 (1 upvotes): Yes, do not start quitting before you have an actual new job and you\'ve started, in fact, if you have a job, and you want to try the new job, if you want to be truly mercenary, you can take PTO for a few days to try out the job to make sure it\'s a good fit. And then quit. Say a personal matter.\\n| Thundersharting (1 upvotes): Start as planned at Job A. Don\'t say anything until contingencies are passed and contract is signed at Job B. Once it is, tell the dweebs at Job A you resign effective immediately. When they ask why, you prefer not to discuss but wish them luck finding a suitable replacement in today\'s challenging market.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jcmp4z'}]

I applied for hundreds job openings, I had only 5 interviews. I am trying to land a job almost a year. Could you please tell me what should I change in my CV to land more interviews and possibly a job? I do have almost 8years of experience. Many thanks to all\\n\\n10 Comments:\\n--------\\n| unsourire (3 upvotes): The random use of bold letters in your written sections is not needed. Also agree everything fits onto one page if you play around with formatting.\\n| | Swagridson (1 upvotes): Hi, got it, thanks!\\n| futurifyai (3 upvotes): Use same bullet format through all page, dont use bold words except headings, they can confuse ats systems, skills section is a bit much, just add skills that you know adequate. Also update them according to your application. Only put job descrp skills if you have them. Soft and technical skills should be on the same part and  match only with job. You can have more but make sure it match with your current application. I think your education would be better on top.\\n| | Swagridson (1 upvotes): Hi, got it, thanks!\\n| saam55 (2 upvotes):  You can easily find a similar resume template here: Resume Inventor (search for it)\\n| No-Quality9864 (2 upvotes): After looking at your resume, there are different areas stronger, your summary can be stronger I personally recommend breaking it up into bullets to make it easier to read. Like this:  \\t\\u2022\\tResults-driven CAE Engineer with 8+ years of experience in Finite Element Analysis (FEA), specializing in durability and stress analysis for automotive powertrain components. \\t\\u2022\\tProven ability to optimize design, increase durability by 40%, and reduce analysis time by 20%. \\t\\u2022\\tAdept at mentoring junior engineers and implementing innovative non-linear analysis methods to enhance product reliability. \\t\\u2022\\tProficient in ABAQUS, ANSA, META, Fe-Safe, and other industry-leading CAE tools. \\t\\u2022\\tOpen to relocation to the UK with visa sponsorship availability. (lead with you are eligible for visa sponsorship) Focus on networking over mass applying; it\\u2019s a great strategy. After or before  applying make sure you are reaching out to people who possibly work for the company and build relationships from there. And make your bulletin points more impactful: Example: Led a durability optimization project that increased product lifespan by 40%, leading to a patented innovation that secured business continuity for Hanon. I recommend the skills section to be under the summary section but I am unsure if this is how they create cv\\u2019s/resumes in UK. When you say familiar with in the skills section i believe it can already make you seem like you need to be trained and that may already put doubt. I don\\u2019t think you need to say familiar with; wait for the interview to speak more about your proficiency and how you are willing to learn and grow. I hope I was able to help.\\n| ananasdanne (2 upvotes): You only have one role, this *really* does not need to be two pages. I\'d put your English as \\"Fluent\\" - not everyone is familiar with the CEFR levels and while correct, \\"Proficient\\" makes it sound like you don\'t master English at the level you probably do.\\n| | Swagridson (1 upvotes): Hi, ok, thanks for your opinion!\\n| AutoModerator (1 upvotes):  **Dear /u/Swagridson!** Thanks for posting.

Hell, delete \\u201cvolunteer.\\u201d\\n| | throwaway25168426 (1 upvotes): Does putting skills at the top help?\\n| | | IndigoBlueBird (1 upvotes): I don\\u2019t put them at all, but if you\\u2019re going to put them, they should not be in the middle\\n| | | | throwaway25168426 (2 upvotes): Mine are at the very bottom, below my education and experience\\n| | standardnewenglander (1 upvotes): 100% agree! No reason to mention unpaid - seconding this advice! :)\\n| | _im_just_here__ (1 upvotes): Quick question, but what should you put down for a position you volunteered in?\\n| AnonymousGoose0b1011 (6 upvotes): I disagree with reddit4bellz, if you are still going for an associates degree you should keep highschool on there. and add the expected date of graduation with associates or at least put \\u201cIn progress\\u201d. Now once you have an associates and you are pursuing your bachelors you can then remove highschool from your resume, and tack on the bachelors with associates\\u2026\\n| | TyagraT (1 upvotes): For the date of the education I put \\"Aug 2024 - Aug 2026\\" implying I am in progress. Is this not enough? or do you think I should put \\"in progress\\" regardless?\\n| | | AnonymousGoose0b1011 (1 upvotes): Generally speaking you only have to list the date or expected date of graduation. So I would just list August 2026 and don\\u2019t worry about the start date. Honestly it\\u2019s personal preference. I used to use \\u201cIn progress\\u201d but then I just changed everything to expect date that way the formatting looks the same.\\n| | | | TyagraT (2 upvotes): alr cool appreciate your advice, Thanks!\\n| hecarimxyz (4 upvotes): The First one. But get rid of the \\u201cunpaid\\u201d word in there. It not necessary as you already put the the word \\u201cvolunteer\\u201d and also, they simple don\\u2019t need to know. Also, your Associates should be above the High School diploma. Generally, the most recent or relevant goes on top in Education. Goodluck op!\\n| | TyagraT (1 upvotes): fixed it, Appreciate you!\\n| kpossibles (2 upvotes): I wish you the best of luck, but you might want to get a part time job somewhere first with a longer current work history than 1 month...\\n| | TyagraT (1 upvotes): I got a Lab Assistant Interview soon on Monday which is probably as close as I\'m going to get, but 100% get what ur saying\\n| | | kpossibles (1 upvotes): This is probably ok for a lab assistant position, but practice your interview answers with someone or prep the answers since that\'s going to probably factor in more with your light work history.\\n| | | | TyagraT (1 upvotes): Appriciate it, definitly guna prep that answers since its a phone interview lmao\\n| standardnewenglander (2 upvotes): You have a good start OP, but I do recommend a \\"revamp\\". Drop the high school diploma if you\'re able. However, if you would like it in there to buff up the resume - put your Associates above the diploma. Since you are new to the workforce, leave the education section near the top of your resume (you can move it lower once you\'ve been in the workforce a couple years).  I\'d move your skills section closer to the top - and parse it out into two sections: technical skills and professional skills.  Also, eliminate the goals section in favor of a \\"professional summary\\". The professional summary would go as the top section of your resume (above education section).  Also, maybe add a projects section below your workforce experience section. A couple projects you\'ve worked on would help by providing an overall theme/motive/direction with your resume and really pull everything together. Good luck OP - you got this!\\n| | standardnewenglander (1 upvotes): Also in your skills section - don\'t bracket your expertise after each skill. Take it out and just leave the skill itself. Be prepared to speak to the skills in the interview where you can give a brief overview of your expertise in-person instead.\\n| 204gaz00 (2 upvotes): The first one seems good I see a missing e on the 2nd power zone.

You\'ll see them when you open Word. Don\'t use Canva. Do this NAME Address / Phone Number / Email 1) Career Summary 2) Education 3) Awards 4) Work History (if you have anything other than volunteer. Ok if not) 5) Skills Google a list of Hard skills and Soft skills, and list the ones relevant to you.\\n| | KeiiLime (1 upvotes): I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s better to put \\u201cexperience\\u201d instead of \\u201cwork history\\u201d, and put the volunteer stuff there.

Ask teachers, community members, coaches, etc. for letters of recommendations. You dont have to give lengthy details on the classes you took, just showing that you took them and got good grades is enough. As you eventually gain work experience, you can eliminate these from your resume. Don\\u2019t forget to add a skills/technology section to your resume that shows any software you\\u2019ve used (email, zoom, teams, microsoft excel/word, etc) and presentation skills, group projects, etc.\\n"}\n', 'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jcrcjy'}, {'title': 'Refining Resume Strategies for Better Interviews', 'text': '{"text":"Title: [3 YoE, Software Engineer, Software Engineer, US]\\nAuthor: LuckNStonks\\nUpvotes: 2\\nBody text: Hey everyone, I\\u2019m a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience, currently working at a non-profit that heavily depends on government funding. I recently hit my 2-year mark, and while I enjoy my work, job security has become uncertain, so I\\u2019ve decided to start applying and brushing up on LeetCode to see what\\u2019s out there. I\\u2019m open to mainly remote, but I\'m also open to hybrid roles if the opportunity is strong enough, and I\\u2019m targeting back-end, front-end, and full-stack positions.

I created a resume for back-end, front-end, and full-stack positions and I\'m planning on adjusting my resume to tailor to the job description while applying, as well as my cover letter.

I ended up in a similar place, got frustrated with not landing interviews after putting so much effort into my applications. It felt like I hit a wall. Here\'s what\'s helped me: First, check out your connections on LinkedIn\\u2014they\\u2019re gold mines for referrals and insider info. Also, applying directly through company career pages can sometimes boost chances compared to just blasting out resumes on big job boards. Another lifeline was automating part of my job hunt. LinkedIn Easy Apply is convenient but can be hit or miss. Actually, I\'ve tried everything from ZipRecruiter to JobMate for simplifying the process. ZipRecruiter was okay, but JobMate really streamlined my apps by auto-applying to tailored jobs, letting me focus on other prep. It\'s something you might find useful given you seem swamped with apps (getjobmate.com if you\'re curious). Make sure you\'re active in coding communities like GitHub or Stack Overflow too; recruiters sometimes scout users there. Clear, concise resumes help, but networking and strategic apps are key these days.\\n| | LuckNStonks (1 upvotes): Solid advice man, I appreciate you. I never thought about utilizing ZipRecruiter or JobMate, that is a great idea. That will also allow me to focus on leetcoding. I push to GitHub frequently for my side projects so it\'s pretty decent, but most of my project repos are private so not sure how helpful that is. I\'m creating a cheat sheet for leetcode so maybe I could push that to github to keep up my contributions. I agree, I do need to work on being more active on GitHub.\\n| | | Key-Boat-7519 (2 upvotes): Pushing that cheat sheet to GitHub sounds pretty smart! I\\u2019ve started sharing my older project tidbits, even snippets I don\\u2019t think are huge, like scripts or tools I use. It\\u2019s wild, but sometimes those little bits catch recruiters\\u2019 eyes. Plus, they make my profile look alive and kickin\\u2019! You could also make some public repos or keep a blog about your coding journey. Totally helps in building your online presence. Just keep your profile as active as possible to pop up on more radars!\\n| | | | LuckNStonks (1 upvotes): Yup, I tend to leave my online presence on the back burner. I need to fix that and maximize my exposure to recruiters. It seems like a lot of this game is just being ready, at the right place, at the right time.
