### FAQ

**1. What is a pipeline?**
- A pipeline is your personalized summary engine. It’s a custom setup where you select specific social media sources, choose the topics or keywords you care about, and set how frequently you'd like to receive updates. Each pipeline delivers targeted summaries straight to your inbox.

**2. How should I write the focus topic?**
- Your focus topic should clearly indicate the specific information or insights you're interested in. This helps us efficiently cut through the noise and deliver exactly what you care about.

**3. Can I put different focus topics under one pipeline?**
- Technically, yes, you can. However, mixing vastly different topics in one pipeline may result in less focused insights. For best results, keep each pipeline dedicated to closely related topics.

**4. Why is this different than using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other LLMs?**
- OxiNews provides content grounded with citations, formatted specifically for easy readability, and scheduled directly to your inbox. It ensures highly focused information retrieval tailored precisely to your perspective and sentiment analysis needs.

1. Direct function call - Trigger upon first pipeline creation

2. Scheduled Cron Jobs

- Users can put in the subreddits of their choice such as r/Jobs, r/resumes etc
- Users can put in a focus topic such as "Trends in Salary Negotiations"
- Users can set a scheduled delivery to receive the summary (daily, weekly etc..)
- The tool goes through all the subreddits at regular intervls and focuses only on the discussions that align with the focus topic. Similar discussions across different subreddits are aggregated.
- Finally a summary of the popular discussions is delivery to the user along with sources, key points and sentiments


Why this tool can only grow better?
- I am betting on AI Models to get significantly better and intelligent at understanding market research. This tool is merely a wrapper around the AI model to make it convenient for consumption. 
- A day will come when deep research models like o1 and r1 are usable for a cheap price. This will help generate insights from reddit and other social media platforms that are truly embeded within. Think of insights that are hard to track but obvious once discovered. NP insights as I would like to think of them. Hard to deduce it but once found easy to verify that it is true
